They were merged together on unique user id, cleaned, which resulted in a big dataframe with the following columns: 'Username', 'Skin_Tone', 'Skin_Type', 'Eye_Color', 'Hair_Color','Rating_Stars', 'Review', 'Product', 'Brand', 'Price', 'Rating','Ingredients', 'Combination', 'Dry', 'Normal', 'Oily', 'Sensitive','Category', 'Product_Url', 'User_id', 'Product_id','Ingredients_Cleaned', 'Review_Cleaned', 'Good_Stuff', 'Ing_Tfidf'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### My Analysis:\n",
    "Little informaton was given on how OP ended up with the final data but the data clearly shows each user's review for a product and other features related to the user and product. We could see that preprocessing and cleaning were done for the review and ingredient columns. The 'Good_stuff' column suggests that it correlates with the rating stars. Amongst the user features, for some reason only the Skin_Type data column were hot encoded."

      "…read more Not good for dry skin at all. Left my face feeling tight and I looked patchy. Will return and get the tatcha. I loved the Lotus Youth Preserve Face Cream, and I accidentally picked this one (similar packaging) and I thought how different can it be. I had a lot of breakouts and the dry areas on my skin got worse. It took more than a week to show these results that I can't even return it now. Very disappointed. I just hope the face cream is not discontinued (as I'm unable to find it on the site). Initially I loved this moisturizer! I have very dry skin, especially in the winter, and I thought I had finally found my skin savior. However, after about a month of use my pores were incredibly clogged and I broke out worse than ever before :( Really wish this would have worked for me! I started to get whiteheads on my face, so there was something in there that was clogging my pores. I do see now it says for “face and elsewhere” so I don’t think this is good for sensitive skin. I wouldn’t put a body lotion on my face. I was hoping this would cure my dry skin and acne combo. It did not help with dryness at all. If anything I had to layer more creams overtop just to not feel any tightness in my cheeks, nose, and forehead. It also seems to clog my pores. I stopped using it on my face and now use it on my body so that I can finish the tub I bought. I wanted to like this product so much. I have combination skin. I have have sections that are so dry and flaky and others that are pretty normal. Well, this stuff did cure the dryness, but it also made my skin so oily that I was having all kinds of breakouts. I tried this product twice and both times it broke me out on the first day smh. I don’t understand what is in this product. I stopped getting acne at around 20 yrs old so it’s really strange that I tried this product and it didn’t react well. I ordered this moisturizer because of the great reviews and I like the idea of combining steps in my morning routine. I made the impulse buy online without ever sampling the product (it was on a flash sale). My first reaction was the awful fragrance! It is STRONG for a product you put on your face. I seriously sneezed the first few times I put it on, it reminds me of something my grandmother would wear. Then, after I had already purchased it, I did a quick search to see if Bobbi Brown products are cruelty-free. I assumed they were because, well, I like Bobbi and she seems lovely? Lol. But she is NOT CRUELTY-FREE. There is no reason to not be cruelty-free in 2020!! There are so many great brands that are good to the planet. I returned this and got Youth to the People Adaptogen Cream and Smashbox Photo Finish Primer. Amazing creams for my dry skin, mild, reasonable fragrances and company practices I want to support. We vote with our $ and I'm voting elsewhere now. Sorry Bobbi\n",

      "…read more Made my redness even worse. Very greasy, very heavy just not good at all. I was really excited to try this after reading reviews, but unfortunately this product did not work for me. The scent is extremely strong, and it caused me to break out. This product wiped off immediately and does not hold. Even if i used a primer and powder. My expectation with a BB cream is that it works without having to use additional products. I would put this product on my face and it was almost like the color changed a few hours later and revealed my pores? Overall really unhappy with the product and would not buy again. Absolutely cannot stand this moisturizer. I have dry skin and this just doesn't soak into my skin. It's extremely frustrating. I would try the yttp kale and spinach green tea hyaluronic acid moisture cream OR the Neutrogena GEL CREAM (extra dry skin formula) NOT the water gel. This moisturizer sits on top of my skin and doesn’t fully hydrate. I still have dry patches and flaky skin. It’s very greasy and feels heavy. I’ve been using this consistently with my other trusted skincare items and it’s broken me out. This has also clogged my pores and I have more whiteheads than ever before. I rarely write reviews for a product but this time I had to come up here because I HATE this thing. This is so overpriced and such a WASTE of my money....... First of all it gave me breakouts over my chin and my jaw. I didn’t want to think it was this so I tried to use it again after my break out went away. Nope, my face broke out again!!!!!!!! I don’t know too much about ingredients but I bought this because I saw all kinds of skincare channels raving about the ingredients in this. In addition, I feel like the texture is really weird, it is almost waxy and it does want to blend out on my skin evenly or skin in. It leaves a film on my skin with a white cast, not that I mind the white cast b/c I use this product at night, but I mean I have dryer skin and I live in upstate NY(winter here is terrible)so I like heavy things. This thing is heavy but it is floating on the top of the skin, not really moisturizing. Plus it smells like straight plastic. Anyways, PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product, it is stupidly expensive. Go get something else like the Curel cream or the belief moisturizing cream (not the gel version) or anything else. Please guys, I think even cetaphile at the drugstore works better.\n",

I thought let me give some days and see the result but no luck. Every time I use this cream my face become so patchy and dull. Light to medium is too light on me, medium to deep is too dark. I just can't seem to win with this BB cream. I loved the coverage too. Do not recommend, gave me a chemical burn/reaction. around my nose and mouth and patches on my cheeks. And gave me a terrible breakout. I cannot stress enough how this ruined my face. It caused such a bad breakout that it was painful to the touch. For reference, I take good care of my skin. I had a travel size of this to pack during my drill weekends and I had to trash it today because it not only broke me out in random places like my chin and jawline, but made my cheeks red and patchy! Not worth the money because it didn’t do anything. I’m returning it. The face dreams and primer I love! I use the C-rush vitamin C gel cream, and i LOVEE it ! In general Ole Henriksen is really good. So i bought this night cream without a doubt. I used it once, and the next morning, i had like little red bump under my skin but wasn't sure if it was the cream, so the next night i apply the cream again, and the next morning, my face was COVER (without exagerration) by huge and little pimple with white head, and during one week, the pimple kept popping. I really don'T know what ingredient this cream made me breakout like this but for sure, i will never use this cream again.\n",

I’ve using this oil for almost 3 years and loved it until I ran out of it and bought a new one at Sephora in Soho. As soon as I opened the bottle there was a bad smell. Never happened to me before. I tried to apply it on my skin but couldn’t pass the smell... so strong ( and disgusting) So I returned it and bought a new one in Williamsburg but same thing! The manager of the store agreed and said she will talk to the beauty advisor of the brand. Please Sephora, check with the brand and remove the bottles that smell bad .. you can’t sell a product like that.

There must be a bad batch out there but when I went to return this, the one on the shelf also smelled the same. It caused bumps on my neck so I had to use on my hands instead. I bought two jars so I wasted my money. I bought face, eye, neck and neck and chest. Ripoff. Each cream seems exactly the same. I noticed no change whatsoever. I’m 53 so this group had a lot of areas to improve upon if they were able. I do not get the hype over this. I diligently used the entire large sized jar, hoping to see something positive happen. Absolutely zero difference, TERRIBLE smell and super expensive. Pass. Im 51 years old and I wanted to love this product. I used it faithfully everyday for about 3 months and saw no results. Maybe if you’re in your 30’s or early 40’s not for 50’s I’m not sure why there are so many good reviews. This mist doesn’t do ANYTHING. I tried over makeup and under makeup, there’s literally no difference. I look the same without it. Overpriced and not worth your money Had high hopes for this sleek beautiful bottle. Stay away if you have sensitive skin! This product made me break out all over, especially on my cheeks and around my nose where I’ve never had a pimple in my life, and I’m a 50 year old woman. Total disappointment and product going back. I really wanted to like this product. I received it free in a gift bag. Unfortunately I tried in a handful of times with the same result each time, a very greasy face. For reference, I do not have oily or dry skin, it's fairly normal.

About the moisture is something that you can find with clarins, la roche posay, neutrogena, olehenriksen, Peter Thomas Roth... this moisturizer isn’t good Truly the worst illuminating moisturizer I’ve ever tried in my life. I thought my first bottle was bad so I gave it another shot but both bottles let me down immensely. I would apply to a clean, dry face and no matter what I would do this product would pill on my face and the tint glitter would chunk up.

Have been ordering this for years and should come with a full compact and one additional refill.Not sure why Sephora changed this product. I returned it to local Sephora store, which did stock original compact but out of my color. Store could not explain why this happened. This was a waste of money for me. No coverage at all. Comes out darker than the models shown. I love dewy cushions but this just accentuates every little skin flake on my skin. My husband said it looked like I rubbed toilet paper all over my face. Regret the purchase. First thing I noticed was that this oil smells really good. Only need to apply a little to skin for each use. Unfortunately, it caused my face to breakout. This product was very heavy on my face and made me break out. Bought it because of all the good reviews and gave it a decent try, but not for me. I used to LOVE this product but the new formula makes my skin burn and it smells like potpourri. I will be returning it. I wish they would go back to the old formula! I am so sad to see the formula was changed and was hoping that it was just the packaging. The old formula was my holy grail and I have been repurchasing for years. The new one feels like a cream gel hybrid in a bad way. Its thinner and a bit sticky and irritates my skin. Whats worse is the fragrance! It is so obnoxious and overpowering like slathering on perfume on your face! So bummed I'll have to start looking for my new go-to moisturizer. Why'd they change something that was so great?! :(\n",

Why change a produce that was so good! something about the formula is different and it doesn't work the same anymore. it now causes irritation on the skin now. the previous formula was the most moisturizing perfect for sensitive skin moisturizer I had ever found. now I can't even use it. :/ i'm kind of afraid to use anything of theirs now because i don't want to risk the irritation i experienced with this one. so i'll use up the old formula of theirs i already have and sadly not rebuy because of the new formula they are using.\n",

It is thick and feels thick on the skin. It just doesn’t perform as I’d expect at this price. Overpriced moisturizer. I was expecting something that was going to just WOW me for the price. Thank god I bought the mini because I would’ve been really mad if I wasted my money on the regular size. So many better options such as Philosophy Renewed Hope in a Jar or Belif Moisturizing Bomb. Don’t fall for the hype. My skin type is combination and after using it for 2 days my skin broke out and I got 3 big pimples on my face. Honestly I had super high expectations and I’m glad I only got the smaller size. I don’t see any glowy or dewy skin at all and I don’t notice anything except how thick it is. I normally use Clinique Repairwear uplifting firm cream which I have actually switched back to (I will alternate to finish this off).

I typically only get breakouts when I eat a lot of sugar and or on occasion. I don’t have very sensitive skin. This product really didn’t even give my skin enough moisture. this is designed for people with combo/oily skin which I have. honestly my skin would get oily after applying this so I didn’t work for me :( Beware if you have sensitive skin. I tried this out for one day and was broken out in blemishes all over by the end of the day. It smells nice and has a nice consistency, just unfortunately did not work for me. I got a sample of this, and it made my skin extremely red, as if I spend all day in the sun. I do well with a few philosophy products, so I was excited to try this one. The consistency was nice and it didn’t affect the tons of green correction makeup I piled on. It wasn’t rigth for me Received a sample. Awful just awful. Burnt my skin. Looks like I have a sunburn. Would not recommend. Breaks apart once you apply makeup. Deal breaker for me. This product left a film on my face that peels off when I rubbed my face. Gross. my skin reacted badly to it and it cause whiteheads, sadly:( pathetic, waste of money. It's the equivalent of spraying your face with water. Every time I use this product I break out. I tried it now three times, and in the morning I always regret it when I wake up. It feels amazing on the skin but my skin can’t handle it. Wish I could return it. Not for me- unfortunately!

I decided to buy this even knowing with every fiber in my body that any antioxidants in jar packaging will be destroyed once its exposed to air and light (hence you should always buy creams/lotions/serums in opaque tube or pump packaging). anyways, after 5 months of use i really haven't noticed a difference in my skin. my fine lines on my forehead and under eyes are still there. I have south asian, dry skin and it really didn't hydrate it much either. In fact, in the evening my face always seemed sorta of drier after using this-- i would have to top it up with another moisturizer (from paulas choice). Anyways, i say pass on this. the ingredient list is wicked but its way too expensive for essentially doing nothing. Must have been the jar packaging!!!! ugh\n",

Red blotches all over my face after a continued use for two weeks. Recently have stopped use of all moisturizers to ensure this was the cause of breakouts and it was.

No no no this is horrible I couldn’t make it even through one use cause it burned like the dickens. Stay away far far away. This product gave me a horrible reaction. Day two and you can see red, raised and textured, hot tracks wherever I rolled this across my skin. Feels like a horrible sunburn. Using antihistamine and topical hydrocortisone but still very uncomfortable. I have never reacted to anything before. My skin type is dry/dehydrated. I tried it for 2 months and didn´t see a difference, it just feel like water but does anything At first it gives you a nice cooling effect but it broke me out after a few uses. I noticed small bumps under my eyes and immediately stopped using the product. A friend of mine had the same reaction. I also don’t think it’s worth the price, it’s a very basic product and it would be better if it wasn’t in stick form.

I will continue to use what I have on mornings when I feel extra tired, or after crying, just because it feels good and cooling. But I would not purchase again. I bought this for my mother after she asked for something to help depuff her under eyes. She gave it back to me after a week of using because it simply doesn’t do anything. It doesn’t moisturize or cool. I don’t know if they changed the formula or not, but I remember being amazed with how cooling it was when it first came out. After getting this back from my mother, I can confirm that it really does nothing. First, full disclaimer: I haven’t used this product. I can’t speak to its effectiveness. I read the description and was so ready to add this to my cart. It’s exactly what I’m looking for (a moisturizer with retinol to use at night so I don’t have to do two different steps), and it’s from a brand I’ve used before and really like. Then, I looked at the ingredients. Dimethicone is the SECOND ingredient on the list. Seriously. I try to avoid silicones in my skincare when I can because they can be pore-clogging, and there is some evidence to suggest silicones can be bad for the water supply, but I’m not necessarily a huge stickler about it. That being said, I would never use a moisturizer where a silicone is literally the second ingredient. Silicones are great in primers because they fill in your pores and help give your skin that silky smooth texture. Why in the world would I want to fill in my pores before bed? And so, my hunt for a nighttime moisturizer with retinol continues...\n",

However, it was disappointing. I used this on a few occasions with different application methods. I always start with small amounts at first, as most kbeauty brands have a “less is more” application method... wasn’t impressed. I tried adding bigger dollops on my face, no larger than a dime... I felt even stickier than before. Then I tried my quartz roller, with about the same amount as last time. After that, I tried applying with my finger tips again but patted it outwards on my face... No matter what I tried, it always made my face feel sticky, and that it just sat on top of my skin. I didn’t even feel that my face was moisturized. It gave the appearance of dewy, moisturized skin... but my face actually felt dryer after each use, and my skin texture went down hill. I will say, that it did not clog my pores though. Overall, I would highly recommend a sample before trying it for yourself. I won’t be recommending it to anyone, and you’re better off with another K Beauty brand.\n",

It has no smell, which is good. It feels kind of hydrating but none of it matters because it’s so freaking sticky and doesn’t even absorb into the skin! It’s so bad I washed my face again to get it off! I felt disgusting, clogged and slimy! Not worth it. Idk where the 5 star reviews are from honestly. I haven’t even used it yet and I know I won’t like it. It smells like glue. I’ve since read reviews and I wouldn’t buy this product. The first week of using this cream was great, second week I started to break out with cystic acne, and that basically continued until I switched face creams. I have oily sensitive skin just for reference. This is such a weird moisturizer! Left my skin super sticky and after about 5 mins of it on my face got super red and hot so I rinsed it off and applied my regular moisturizer. Wanted to love this, but it’s not for me Didn’t like this at all. Very creamy but settled in wrinkles and made my eyes look worse not better. Product is difficult to apply. It covers but is too heavy. In addition it creases. As others have said, I desperately wanted to love this product but it made me break out like never before. I enjoyed the heavier texture and the moisturization it gave my skin. Unlike other moisturizers it did not seem to “pill” when I put on makeup, and I genuinely enjoyed using it until my face broke out. I’ve given it almost a week, and my skin is only getting worse. I have very clear skin. I usually only get a few hormonal blemishes, but this made my forehead and sides of face break out like crazy. It stared as raised bumps and has progressively turned into white heads. I also noticed my face is incredibly itchy! I am very disappointed and will have to return.\n",

My cheeks were extremely greasy every time I used it and I ended up returning it. Let me start by saying that the regular non SPF version of this is decent. Not super hydrating but not DEHYDRATING. This one felt like it was taking moisture OUT of my skin. I was using it during summer when my skin is usually more normal and it made it feel so dehydrated and dull. I didn’t like this one at all. The first time I tried it, I woke up with eight new zits on my face. Returned it the next day My skin is the type to agree with mostly anything that is labels hydrating or moisturizing. My skin did not agree with this product at all. This enlarged my pores, caused irritation, and created small zit like bumps that had me itchy all night. I put up with this mask twice before I gave up. I really tried to like this. I tried this in the store and it felt great. Then, I got it home and used it for a week. Other reviewers said it made their face feel greasy, and I couldn’t figure out why. Then, the stuff just started to sit on top of my skin and it felt grossly greasy. It barely soaked into my skin, and I have dry skin! The one point the Sephora team member made was that this isn’t a water-based moisturizer, so that’s the main reason I think it wouldn’t absorb. Also, as others have noted, the smell of it isn’t so great. I took it back and exchanged it for another moisturizer.\n",

I like the Drunk Elephant Whipped Cream better for moisturizing my skin. For the first time ever I am actually allergic to this product.

While it did an okay job of evening out my skin tone, it feels so heavy and greasy on my skin I can't stand it. Returned. It's make my skin so dry. I had to return it. It's not freeze time at all. Have been using this product for three months and have seen zero results. i actually find when i wake up in the morning it makes my skin look worse. like all my wrinkles are squished together. Not worth the $50. I find my $15 anti wrinkle olay night mask gives me better results. Will not be repurchasing. This product gave me a pimple on my chin and another pimple on my forehead. It never absorbed in my skin, left an extremely noticeable sheen on my face the entire time. I cannot recommend this product at all. I will go ahead and use it on my feet and chest area. Lastly, it smells very bad. I have super dry skin - washing with water makes my skin feel tight. I was excited to try an \"ultra\" moisturizer, but this just feels STICKY on top of my skin. It doesn't feel like my skin is absorbing any of it. Every time I used this product it irritated & burned my eyes! When I applied the moisturizer I kept it as far as possible from my eyes & this would still happen! I am very disappointed because I always heard many good things about this product. Not the right fit I guess! The first night I used this I woke the next day and had 6 huge clogged pores on my forehead. My main struggle is clogged pores on my forehead and skin texture and this product irritated my skin and further worsened my skin. Before this product my skin texture was finally starting to smooth out and I had zero clogged pores. This product is also very thick and you need like 6 pumps for it to even barely remove your makeup. Very disappointed\n",

I just can’t figure out why this product has so many good reviews. I’ve never used a serum that dried my skin more than this one. Don’t waste your money. Feels like putting water on your skin except water is free. Smelled great but it broke my face out really bad. Unfortunately. I had high hopes for this cleanser but it made my skin freak out ! I got unbelievable texture and several cystic pimples, which I had under control. I gave this cleanser a few weeks to purge before trashing it I was excited about this in hopes that it would get my oil in control, however it did not. For some reason I felt it made my skin MORE oily. I am someone who takes care of my skin and makes sure it's not another variable causing the issue. It just doesn't work. If you have oily skin you're better off going with a mild cleanser without fragrances and irritants Do not use this cleanser if you struggle with fungal acne. The second ingredient is sodium cocoyl isethionate, which feeds malassezia. There are other ingredients in there as well that worsen fungal acne. I made the mistake of buying this on a whim without checking the ingredients and I started to breakout again after a couple uses. The idea of oil control is cute but this product seems to do more drying than balancing. This is probably the last time I buy from Ole Henriksen as the brand doesn’t seem to understand the importance of pH and often uses comedogenic ingredients. Cute aesthetic tho.\n",

I Usually love Clinique but not this product. I have combo skin and this actually seems to make it oilier after I wash my face. So much I’ve skipped moisturizing altogether. It does not balance nor does it clear my skin if anything I think it’s breaking me out! It definitely leaves my face cloudy and I think it has a fragrance in it that’s irritating my face. Also with the lid shut it seems to be leaking from the bottle into the lid and actually seemed like it’s half empty. It actually looked half full after 1st couple of uses and I don’t use that much when I wash my face for it to look that way. Super disappointed . And won’t purchase again.\n",

I tried this for 30 days and it broke me out SO bad. Wish I could give this 0 stars. It clogged my pores on cheeks and chin :( I think I will go back to my Clarins lotion with Iris . After using this toner for a few months, i noticed no differences. My skin was more dry after using the toner compared to other toners. And now i have dry patches and itchy skin!! I don’t notice any other changed either! This is a no for me. I try to stay away from products that contain alcohol or any sort of added fragrance. This has both. But I tried it out anyway because it has plenty of hydrating ingredients that I do look for in a toner. But the scent from this is very strong and not nearly as hydrating as I hoped it would be. If you're looking for hydration, try the Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner by Fresh or the Vanilla Milk Toner by Kylie Skin.\n",

After using it a few times I had 3 huge pimples on my face along with small red bumps. My skin is normally smooth but now very textured and bumpy. I threw it in the trash and will go back to the YTTP cleanser. This was a total fail for me. Not a fan was very irritating on my eyes and didn’t do much. I purchased the small bottle and after going through it without any complaints, I decided to purchase the larger bottle. After a couple washes I began forming red dots all over my cheek area. I have pretty normal skin, very rare breakouts, etc.. you have been warned! Wanted to love this but it feels like washing your face with soap. I’ve got combination skin and this made my face feel so tight and horrible! Please don’t waste your money! There’s so many gorgeous cleansers out there for half (or less!) this price. I had very high hopes for this exfoliating cleanser, and it turned into my skins worst nightmare. I had never had cystic acne until I tried this product. This cleanser broke me out SO BAD! Used it for about two weeks and ended up returning it. Wasn't very exfoliating. I returned because I prefer my usual cleanser. This was more of an impulse buy. I should've known better for my skin. My skin type is combination but a little more sensitive to dryness. I also have scars. The first night I put it on it immediately dried up my skin. It didn't feel fresh nor like it was really cleansing my skin. It feels like the type of dryness you get with a bar of soap. Like nothing. That's usually not a good sign for me. I had to moisturize several times in the span of a couple hours.\n",

However, I used this for a day and the next morning, acne started showing up. At first, I just thought it was a new cleansing oil I bought but when I did my skincare routine the next night I realized it was this product.

To my astonishment, after taking a hiatus from Clinique and repurchasing this bottle, I found that in the ingredients Denatured Alcohol is unabashedly listed! I had been using this lotion for a week and I reflected on my skin. I noticed my skin was breaking out like crazy, fine lines were starting to form all over my face, there were areas of dryness/coarseness that weren't there before. Sadly, I will no longer use this product.

Stay away from this product if you have acne prone skin. It doesn’t clear up acne but it will help you to make you acnes worst! I’m going to return this product and go back to my old cleansing wash to clear up this mess! It is terrible. Horrible . Makes you get more pimples . It does give that fresh clean look on your skin but then you wake up with twice the pimples . I have been using this for a month maybe to see if my skin with get used to it but i have NEVER seen my skin so bad . And i usually don’t get a lot of pimples on my face I used to break out in my twenties and thirties but since I’ve been in my forties, it’s a rare occurrence. I started using this cleanser about two weeks ago and I’ve been breaking out. Because my acne-prone days are behind me, I feel confident this isn’t a temporary purge. The breakouts are even in odd places for me, such as above my upper lip and on my neck. I wish I knew which ingredient is the problem so I can avoid it in the future. If you have even slightly breakout prone skin, avoid this! It didn’t help with oil either.\n",

It was recommended to me by a Sephora employee to buy this over another brand for taking makeup off. It does not do its job and I feel as if my face is not actually getting clean from it. It caused me to get acne on my cheeks which never happens to me! It also claims to be a foaming cleanser and it definitely does not foam up. Definitely not worth the price. This product does not do a good job at cleaning the skin at all. I have combination skin and my main concern is pores. Please bring back the original formula. I have used this for YEARS, and It’s not the same. It does leave a weird film on your face. I don’t know what to buy or do now. I really haven’t ever been so loyal to a cleanser. I am sad now and am looking for something else. I have most Sunday Riley products and love them, but this and the foundation really disappointed me. :-( I just finished my bottle of this cleanser and based on the reviews here, I'll probably go with another product. This was an amazing cleanser and I'm sorry to see it isn't anymore. So bummed. I used this cleanser for a few years and sang its praises for what it did for my large pores. Now the new formula makes my skin feel dry and awful! PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!! Have to add to the chorus of reviews, the original formula was my HG cleanser, please bring it back! I was devastated when they reformulated this cleanser! Ceramic Clay Slip was my go-to, it was the best cleanser I'd ever tried in my life, and I repurchased it for years. But once the \"Clay\" in Ceramic Slip got dropped, it all went downhill. The consistency feels much oilier now, no longer refreshing, and feels like a film sitting on top of your skin after washing off. This new formula ended up breaking me out and I was so sad, it was back to the drawing board to find a new HG cleanser. This seems to be a pattern with Sunday Riley within the last year, and the unfortunate thing is the company is not being forthright about the changes to their most famous formulas (Good Gene's being the biggest culprit...nothing like it once was, many long-time users agree and SR just denies it). It's such a shame, because the products seriously worked wonders! But now, not nearly as effective and the same high prices don't reflect the obvious changes. If this was two years ago, I would've enthusiastically recommended this cleanser without hesitation. However, as a long-term Sunday Riley consumer, I unfortunately have to say this is a definite \"pass.\" There are far better cleansers out there to spend your hard earned dollars on.\n",

Rough on the skin. I have since tried the Sephora rose cleansing wipes and it’s softer on my skin. Rough on skin, didn't cleanse that well, not as good as Cetaphil cleaning wipes. I was really excited to try this. I have very oily skin. I had been using dr Dennis gross alpha beta gel cleanser and I wanted to try something different. The boscia left me with several dry patches (which I never have) and several blackheads on my nose and whiteheads on my cheeks and chin. I used for approx 3 weeks.

Not good for dark spots, not good to oily skin, not effective against acne, overly dried face. Just not a good cleanser. They are highly scented even though fragrance is NOT listed as an ingredient.

I used it for a while too thinking my skin needed to get users to it, but the moment I switched to another cleanser, my skin improved. It’s also too perfumed. Was not a fan of the smell. Does not remove waterproof mascara. A disappointment. Very disppointed with this product. I swear by their LASH DOUBLING MASCARA but the eye make-up remover I poured down the sink. I went back to using the OIL-FREE NEUTROGENA eye make-up remover which is twice more efficient. Just awful. If I could’ve given no stars I would. Sephora didn’t have my best loved Nars eye makeup remover and I wanted an oil free one. That’s about all it has got going for it as it stung my eyes and didn’t even remove my eye makeup. I recently purchased this cleaner as I wanted to try out this brand. I actually bought this a couple of days before my birthday so this was a huge disappointment when I tried it out. I wouldn’t consider myself to have sensitive skin so be careful if you are thinking of trying this product. The product says to use daily which is what I did. My face has broke out with bumps and is itching all over my face. It looks like I have acne and never usually have issues with my skin. It has been 4 days and the bumps have not gone down.

However, for the first time, I was disappointed with the product. This BARELY removed my makeup. it only smeared it all over my face with 3 pumps. I recommend taking your money to a different product if you want something that will actually cleanse your face and remove your makeup. The reason I gave this a 1 out of 5 is because of the smell. While the gentleness of this product is great, it’s just hard to get over the weird spoiled milk smell of it. I tried using it to take off my foundation and it didn’t work at all, it’s just kinda a flop especially for how much it costs. This is a lame product. I was going to buy soy face cleanser but I accidentally got this. I thought it is like foam version cleanser but it is a MAKEUP REMOVER and absolutely does not remove my makeup. I use doublewear foundation btw, which is super thick. I don't throw it away but it is honestly useless. I am using it to clean my hand after doing makeup.

I was sold this after an associate told me it’s great for sensitive skin and removes waterproof makeup. I ended up with a big dry patch around my mouth and nose and it was as good at removing waterproof mascara as using just water. Returned this. I did not feel like product did anything to help my skin. It made my skin oily and made my pores look bigger. It also has a chemical smell mixed with the citrus scent, but it seemed to go away once it dried. I love love love la Mer but this broke me out on my forehead and jawline. I think it’s too perfumed for my temperamental skin. Sent back! Did not remove all of my makeup. Made my face feel so dry and tight. Not a fan of the smell or price tag. Ouch. I used to use this years ago and it was beautiful it was gentle and it was creamy and light and took my makeup off with zero irritation. Well they must have reformulated it and added more chemicals and fragrances because it ruined my skin. My skin has been sore for three days now , it’s just finally calming down. Caudalie has some lovely products but they should really cut back on the unnecessary chemicals and fragrances in their products because most of us now days are hyper sensitive to harsh fragrances.\n",

I was having to wash my face more often because my face got SO oily SO fast, I've never experienced anything like that before! I couldn't bear to use it any longer because I had never seen my skin so yucky looking.

I purchased this because it's a beauty rule: Cleanse, Tone, Serum, and Moisturize. For many years, I was yo-yoing with different types of toners because it's supposively essentials for acne prone and oily skins. From Proactive to Clinique toners even Lancome. It just doesn't work. It makes my skin rough and drying and thus, breakouts. I hated toners. I wanted to give it another try and maybe this Belif Toner will give better skin results because of the fewer harse ingredients. Unfortunately, no significant result. I finally ran out last week and been thinking to purchase another type of toner. But looking back, my skin feels much smoother and hydrated WITHOUT it. Toner is not necessary and could probably do harm than good for acne skins. I'm finally giving up on toners. It DOES NOT WORK!!! Our skin naturally hydrates and returns to neutral pH level after 15 minutes of washing our face. Toning is useless. My new basic rule: Cleanse, Eye Cream, Serum, Moisturizers, and Protect. That's all you need. Don't waste your time and money on 11 different products layering on top of each one. Stop all the BS.\n",

My black liquid eyeliner that isn’t waterproof took much more scrubbing to get off. It felt tight that my skin felt stripped. I don’t have sensitive skin but dry and sometimes in the winter get small dry patches under my eyes. Using this made my skin feel so dry. I used my usual lotion and I felt burning. After about an hour I started to feel some itching. It wasn’t an allergic reaction more like the product was harsh. The smell isn’t great either. The next day I had some red rash-y areas.

I stopped using it and a few other products and my skin went back to normal within a few days. I have since tested this product twice more without adding or removing any other products to my routine, and each time within 2 days my skin again became very dry and flaky. Each time I took a break from the product, my skin was back to normal within a few days. Effects are consistent whether the product is used once per day or once every other day, indicating to me that either this product is too harsh for sensitive skin, or possibly I am allergic to an ingredient in the product.

These wipes made my break out, and as a result I returned these. I will say that these wipes are very good at cleaning akin and removing makeup. As well the wipe is quite large and you can probably get away with only using half a wipe. Had I not broken out badly I would have continued using these. I found that this did not work for me. It did not remove my eyeliner and felt thick and goopy. This went back. Broke me out! I also got whiteheads and cystic type acne, and it is still taking me months to get my skin to recover and I never had acne before...please don't use this product! or patch test it. It is soap. That cost $12. Call me a fool. Save your money. (It also made my husband who has sensitive skin break out into a rash.) Extremely messy. You know going into it that a charcoal body product will be messy, but this one goes above and beyond that. With a quick drying, hard to scrub off formula. I love Murad products and thought that I would give this cleanser a try due to the really good reviews on here. However, it made my dry and sensitive skin feel super dry, tight, and have that grippy feeling to it after using it. It starts out creamy, but once you rinse with water it really foams up. Foaming cleansers tend to strip my skin no matter what though. It also has a very distinct soapy scent, which I didn't enjoy. I feel like this product would be wonderful for people with oily or combination skin or even people who like that super clean grippy feeling after cleansing, but I do not unfortunately. Will be going back to exchange for my kopari cleansing oil.\n",

I tried this product several times hoping I could either get used to the scent or see some sort of impact on my skin. After using it at least 5-7 times, I observed no positive effects on my oily skin and the smell was just too unpleasant to deal with. Gurl that SMELL. It smells like a dumpster. Don’t buy it sweetie. I feel like this product really doesn't do much at all for my skin. I have combination skin and bought this on recommendation from a Sephora associate. I'd heard good things about the brand so I shelled out the dough for it. It's slightly cooling when you put it on, but I found it made my skin sticky and gross. It also smells like straight up VOMIT. I'm not mincing words here because I think people need to know this before they buy- the smell of this toner makes me sick to my stomach every single time I use it. The smell dissipates fairly quickly, but since it really isn't great on my skin, I just don't think this is worth it. Maybe if I used it every single day for a long time, I'd see some results since it is skincare and it can take time to see a payoff, but with the smell, I can't bring myself to use it.\n",

I knew the odor was going to be pungent but even after reading the reviews I figured it can’t be that bad. I was so wrong. The smell is horrible. I’ve only used it twice and I just can’t use it again. The smell makes me sick. I honestly can’t say if this works or not because I can’t use it because the smell is horrible. Believe me when I say this stuff STINKS. Literally. This is honestly the worst. The woman in the store told it would smell a little “natural”. By natural she meant pond algae. It was terrible. There is no masking the scent. I couldn’t get past it. My husband wouldn’t come anywhere near me. It could be the most effective product on earth, but the smell is horrendous. Hate the smell. Also, it's hard to lather. Definitely can't use this everyday. YO THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT IVE EVER USED!! Do not waste your money one this product. It broke my face out so much and I will never be buying anything from this brand ever again. Thats how upset I am about the results it gave me. My birthday is next week and I have to somehow clear up my face before then!! I’m very surprised no one has mentioned how sticky this is! I just received it and washed my face off, worked pretty good for makeup removal. Then I put on a medium amount for a night mask and I can barely stand it! I am about to get up and wash it off I could not sleep like this. Also has quite a strong perfume smell that I’m not loving. I plan on taking this back tomorrow. Super bummed. very rough on skin the make up does bot even wash off the cloth i want to return not worth the $22 This is one of the worst toners I have used, irritated my skin and it has alcohol big no no. This caught my eye as I was browsing one day. I thought, wow I could use a cleanser for winter since my skin will be more dry. I fell in love with the scent and bought it. Took it home and used it once. I noticed my face felt like I’d used a bar of soap immediately after washing it off. My skin dried out over night and had so many rough patches the next day. Returned! NOT FOR DRY SKIN. I’ve been using this product for 14 days now, but today I decided to call it quits. When it lathers it feels nice, however as I rinse it off, it’s hard to do that gently without feeling like my hands are dragging on my face. Then, I’d notice my face would have slight redness and a bit of stinging around the lower half of my face. After a few uses, the same thing would happen but I started noticing tiny bumps around my chin and jawline (I only break out on my cheeks and forehead), also my pores never looked clean. Today I used a standard CeraVe cleanser and my jawline is already starting to feel normal again. I wanted to like this considering it’s $26 and “natural” but NOPE. I’ll be returning it. The one star is just because it smells nice, but fragrance is no helper either.\n",

Breakouts aren’t exactly what I want from a toner, so, it’s a no from me. I wont use this. It smells like old cigarettes. Its awful. The smell. The scarce amount of exfoliant particles. The texture. It was all just a major miss for me- did nothing for my skin and it felt like I still needed to wash my face again after I used it. Usually I love FAB but this was returned. Made my skin more red and Irritated :/. I love Kiehls but this toner wasn’t for me Wish I had listened to the reviews about this product burning when it was used but I figured I would give it a shot because maybe my experience would be different.

I have sensitive combination skin that is acne prone. I used this twice and I have never had my skin react so poorly to a product before this one.

I was a little disappointed as all of the Kiehl’s products that I have tried and currently use are amazing for my skin but not this one. I plan to try another toner from the line and hope to get better results. Found this to be too harsh for the face. Felt like scrubbing sandpaper on the face. So I even tried to be gentle with scrubbing, but still would feel like my cheeks got a rug burn. This product reminds me of St Ives’ apricot walnut scrub, the kind that was slammed for being too abrasive and harsh. I ended up mixing this with a body scrub. It is nice as a body scrub but way too expensive to be used as such. Turmeric is minimal. Smell is nice. This is way too harsh for the face but OK for body use. There are just better scrubs out there so this one is a pass for me. Did not do anything for my skin, no brightening. I used it as a body wash to finish the tube. I wanted to like it as much as I like Volition gelee mask. For the price and the name of the product, I was very hopeful that this would get rid of some of my more stubborn mascara. Did not work. Even after rubbing my eyes vigorously, it would still leave on mascara and I had to double up with a second make-up remover. Not worth the money at all! I bought this and I regret not reading the ingredients ...... alcohol is mostly in it , alcohol drys out your skin I’m scared to even use this . I hate having dry skin and flakes . I will be returning this as soon as I can it’s full of alcohol I try to stay away from stuff like this but for the first time I just trusted Clinique and just bought it . Big mistake I would not recommend this product for oily skin because it makes it worse. When I get a toner I want it to make my skin feel refreshed and renewed. Not something to make my skin feel more oily and clog my pores. My skin just felt sticky and it made no visible difference to my skin. It also made my makeup pill. I tried using less and still got the same pilling. I wanted to change my skincare products after using them for 3years so I ran to Sephora and bought this along with Laneige's moisturizer and Cleanser with really high hopes of getting a more glowing skin. After only 5 days of usage I was regretting my decision...my skin broke out so bad. I was so disappointed. I dont enjoy layering myself up with makeup and like investing into good skincare products so I can maintain the natural glow and freshness on my face. These products ruined it all for me.\n",

It's a bit deceptive because after using it your face looks really nice and it minimizes your pores, but it's really just slicked away every drop of moisture left after cleansing. I've used both of the toners Laneige sells, and I did not have the same problems with the other one. I know alcohol is one of the main ingredients in both, but their other toner didn't feel as drying, nor did it cause any breakouts. I have combination skin, which both claim to work for. I'm not sure why this particular toner caused so many problems for me.\n",

Not sure what else to say, but did not work with me, will unfortunately have to return This product left my face worse than it was when I started using it. It leaves my face completely dried out. My face has started flaking and now has dry patches and even more discoloration than before. It also has a really strong alcohol smell that makes my eyes water. Very disappointed. I usually enjoy Origins products but this one wasn’t for me. The strong alcohol fumes were too much for me. Sigh. The hunt continues for a toner for me! I rarely ever react to any product. I recently purchased the Fresh Pressed powdered cleansing packets. I followed the directions exactly as they are written on the box, and this product has caused severe breakouts all over my face. I have not changed any other product in my beauty routine. If you have sensitive skin, I would reconsider purchasing this. I used about half of the bottle over a period of about 3 weeks before I realized this product was causing my skin more redness and an overload of tiny bumps across my forehead. Most of the time “clean” products are good to my skin but this cleanser made my skin worse. It made me breakout. I didn’t even realize it was this product causing it. Stopped using it for a few weeks and then when I resumed my skin flared back up again. Really disappointed because I’ve tried several micellar waters and none have cause breakouts. I love the idea of having toner in a spray bottle but I HATE the smell. It’s like a mix of rose and bubblegum. I wouldn’t mind it that much if it was a subtle scent but it’s like spraying perfume on your face. I’m returning it. I purchased this because I hoped it would reduce pores visibility on my face. I read good review about it. The company website said it noncomedogenic. However, I regret buying this because it causes breakouts. My face is now full of pimples. I do not recommend this product for acne prone and sensitive skin. This product is just a bunch of silicones that give the appearance of smooth skin, but does absolutely nothing. It’s a waste of money... its like an overly priced primer basically. On the other hand highly recommend the night repair serum is worth it! I hate to say but this did nothing for me. Maybe because I don't have any significant signs of aging at 28, but I found it didn't make my skin more radiant either. I bought it because of the hyped up reviews and used it for a year every night and found no difference in my skin at all. I wanted to like it but felt it had a very silicone after feel as well :( oh well This was way too harsh for me. Even when applied after serums and creams, or diluted with serums and creams, and used only 1x/week, it still made my skin flake. I tried multiple times and never was able to build a tolerance. I have tolerated other retinol products well. I made it through barely one application before giving up. The twist-up twist-down pump kept closing on me and the bright yellow color was a total turnoff. I don't care how good the formula is; I won't try it again. Hate this brand. All products are not good for sensitive skin like they claim to be. This product and the AM triple duty eye cream specifically were just irritating and extremely drying, especially for this one only being .25 % retinol. Just terrible. There are so much better brands and products. Staying away from this brand altogether from here on out! I went to Sephora looking for something to help with a new sun spot I had developed. I was recommended this product however it ended up creating white (I have an olive skin tone) splotches on my check where I used the cream. 2 Months of diligent 1 pump daily morning use, and my sunspots and light skin damage have not altered. In fact, my skin is worse. SEE PHOTO PROOF I understand the Vitamin C and ingredients are meant to 'resurface' the skin, and this can cause light breakouts - but if you view my photo of before and after, you can see visible current breakouts and MORE scarring damage caused by the ones I have had over the 2 months. Some light zits became very problematic and even with careful care, damaged skin that was clear before. The small zits/skin irritation should outweigh the effectiveness BUT IT DOES NOT. Proof is in the photos that my light sun damage under eyes and on cheek bones did not reduce or lighten at all. Visible skin irritation and breakouts daily for 2 months is unacceptable for no results. I wish I could get a refund on this product. As it is, I have to spend the next month repairing my skin in time for a family wedding. Out $100 dollars and MORE skin damage?!? Furious and heartbroken.\n",

I noticed the first time I used it, my skin was burning and turned red but calmed down after awhile. I do have sensitive skin and need to be careful with new products. After using about 2 days, my face broke out in red irritated bumps, which a few of his masks have done to me in the past. I stopped anything I had not been using for some time, had to stop my actives, and waited until skin cleared to re-introduce again. After the bumps cleared up my skin was so dry you could see flakes. I confirmed with Perricone customer service on when to apply, and was told after serums, and before moisturizer. Same thing occurred. I tried once more and that was it, there is something in this that doesn't agree with my skin. He mentions the Rosemary as a major ingredient, which is a known irritant, yet it is listed so far down the ingredient list, that it is doubtful that caused the problem.

Unfortunately I am not a fan! Didn’t see any difference in over 3 months. Would like to return, but don’t have the box any longer. Hated the applicator, difficult to get product out and apply into the skin. No difference in the appearance of my scar after consistent use. I literally used the whole product over time and nothing happened. Super disappointed :-( Did absolutely nothing. Use everyday on a very small scar until the bottle was used up several months later. My (then-new) shallow scar remains as brilliant as the day I started. The good reviews seem very suspect in hindsight. Been using as directed for months. I actually broke out even more with this product and my acne scars are still there. I’ve gotten bumps all over my forehead and they won’t go away now. Since I’ve stopped using this product, I’m seeing improvement. Did not work for me and made my acne worse. I don't think it's a good idea for anyone with acne to use this product or any rollerball product because the acne spreads through the rollerball. Face peeled. Dry patches. My skin isn’t sensitive at all and it’s a recurring issue it seems with this product. This serum sounds like it would be amazing because it’s a three in one with retinol, vitamin c, and hyaluronic acid in the one serum. I was REALLY excited for this because of that reason but it broke me out after I used it for two weeks. Lots of bumps and rough texture on my cheeks, some painful pimples around my mouth and jawline.

I was really hoping this product would live up to some of the rave reviews it has but it didn’t unfortunately :( I ended up returning it because for the price, I could get something that actually made a difference in my skin. This stuff doesn’t actually help make pores physically smaller, it acts like a primer to put a layer of silicons over your pores which makes them look smoother. However once you watch it off, I found they were the same as before, if not worse. My pores on my nose got clogged when I used this and whiteheads developed which never happens to me, even with regular primers. I also found it was hard to wash off, for several days after I first started using it my pores were looking smoother after I washed my face and I thought ‘wow this stuff is really working!’ Then I started breaking out and did a strong exfoliating scrub and mask to clear up the whiteheads. When I rinsed the scrub off I noticed ‘pilling’ was happening - which was weird because my skin should have been totally clean at that point. I realized it was this product, still on my skin after an aggressive scrub! I finished scrubbing it off and realized that it had been on my skin all week, though multiple face washes and make up removers. after I finished removed it, I realized my pores were not improved at all, they were the same.\n",

I didn’t see any difference with this, and the formula does not absorb well or feel nice. I did not like this product. It is difficult to use and I saw no results after extended use. I bought this product in store and when I opened the box there was a few peels that inside didn’t have the peels and that was one thing but the next thing was I was sold a product WITH MOLD. As you can see below in the videos and pictures. I contacted Sephora and they didn’t care at all and didn’t compensate or help me in anyway I’m really disappointed that Sephora would sell me and maybe even a different customer not only a damaged product but a product with MOLD. Please be careful ladies and check before purchasing. Definitely re thinking of to continue to a be a rouge, I received horrible customer service and nothing was done.\n",

I didn’t notice any improvement in that. It does smell nice though and I like the consistency. So, this is a real review of the product and not one of the false ones the company has been pushing out there through its employees. (Google it for the info. A lot of these five stars are fake reviews.) I got this in my Ipsy box, and it took me a while to try it. When I did, I didn't notice a single difference. Since then, I've been using other serums that actually make a difference that I can noticeably see. I used the entire container before giving up and switching to a better serum. This is more like a lotion, and I got nothing from it. Given the price tag and information on fake reviews, I'm not liking this product or brand at all.\n",

The results wash off and your skin looks not so great. I don’t think I have ever used a product that is so hyped that turned out to be the worst product I have ever used.

The texture is lovely. However, it doesn’t work for me. I had heard so many good things about this serum and was super excited to try it out but I did not have those results. I have dry and dehydrated skin to begin with. My skin become so dry after using this, once I stopped using this my skin became 10x better. if you have dry skin, I would first try a sample of this before getting the full size. I've been using these radiance pads for about a month now - I see no different in the texture of my skin. This has been such a disappointment - the first time a 'First aid beauty' has been ineffective. Don't waste your money on this useless product. Did nothing to my face, and actually gave me more texture on my skin, I did not want to waste the money so some people recommended using it under armpits and other areas These did not do anything for me. Plus have no scent. I’ve used almost all the pads and each time feel like I’m simply wiping my face with water. A definite not get again. Doesn’t work at all. Been using this for serval months and my usual red cheeks are still just as red every day. Doesn’t moisturize or do anything good. Would not recommend and will not buy again. I've been using this product for 2 months, and I have seen zero results. I have very sensitive, dry skin with rosacea and hyperpigmentation, and cannot tolerate retinoids. I was hoping this would be an option for me, but it seems to be completely inert. It does nothing. I guess the only positive would be that it feels like nothing too - zero skin reactivity. I wish I could comment on how effective this product is, but alas, I cannot as I had to wash it off after 10 minutes due to the overwhelming fragrance (which gave me a headache). Such a shame as there really is no need to put so much fragrance in a skin care product. Is it supposed to feel like hot glass spreading over your face while gently applying this product? I wish I had returned this product. This product is useless. Didn't notice any results whatsoever. It's like putting a regular hand moisturizer on your face. Not sure why I thought this would be effective. Have used nearly the entire bottle and have noticed no change whatsoever. Awful awful. Every time I would try it again because maybe this time it would work ...smh ....breaks my skin out on tiny white heads all over. 23F with mostly clear skin.

After using this product consistently for 4 months, I believe that these reviews are still fake. My acne did not clear up AT ALL in that time frame.

This did make a noticeable difference in my skin in just three days, however, I have to give it one star because of the fragrance. I am sensitive to fragrance, this sticks with me all day and seems to attach itself to clothing as well. The fragrance so close to my eyes makes them watery and irritated, I had to stop using this product. I am a fan of Algenist products, just not this one. There was absolutely nothing in the bottle. I don’t have a Sephora close by so I order online. It was packaged fine. No breakage or anything. I was so disappointed. It’s not a cheap item that I wouldn’t feel bummed when the bottle was practically empty :( this bottle is truly a bizarre packaging choice — unable to get any product out at all. Not for dry skins. After application, my skin felt super dry and crusty. I always wear sunscreen and my face ended up having white spots sometimes crust!! It’s just a no no Really not a fan of this product. It is incredibly hard to dispense due to the product being too thick for the dropper, so you just have to shake it out (annoying and sometimes wasteful when you get too much). I also don't feel like it provides any \"blurring\" effect at all. Returned. Did not experience any blurring or perfecting effect. Not worth the expensive price tag. This does not blur or do anything. Very disappointed with my purchase :( I see no difference while using this product. Waste of money. I read the amazing reviews and had high hopes. It did not work for my cystic acne it severely dried skin and my blemish did not reduce in size or heal faster. Very sad this did not work. Both my niece and I followed the directions exactly, but to no avail. I will stick with Peace Out brand until I can find another liquid acne treatment. I gave this product a chance to work for over 30 days, using every other day initially and gradually allowing my skin to adjust — but it was overly fragrant, dried my skin, caused minor blemishes and irritations, and the product became flaky with moisturizer applied over it. I should preface with stating that my skin is rather sensitive. I typically stray away from harsher products since I’ve had rough experiences in the past with products that contain heavy amounts of exfoliating agents. However, the reviews made it hard for me to pass up trying this one, so I gave it a shot! I had been suffering from a minor breakout along my upper lip region so I bought these to try and correct the breakout while improving the rest of my face. Within two days, I had giant, cystic zits form on both cheeks (roughly 3-4 on both cheeks), three along my chin, and three along my forehead. Plus, two more emerged along my upper lip. It’s been nearly a month now and I’m still trying to combat the breakout that emerged after using these. While i’ve considered that my skin was purging, it shouldn’t have been that extreme. I had really high hopes, and I hope it works for you! Unfortunately, it didn’t work for me.\n",

Please do not buy this, it gets sticky and smells after awhile Very oily residue and smells like I washed my face with fish oil This product used to be my favourite until they changed the ingredients. A few years back the oil smelt very fresh and citrusy and the colour used to be more yellowish with the tiny gold particles. However, now it smells like really bad oil that’s gone bad and it became a clear oil with gold particles that wouldn’t stick to add a glow to your face. I recently went to a Sephora and the store manager opened another new bottle for me and it still smelt like it had gone past it’s expiry. I don’t know what they changed in it’s formula but I wouldn’t recommend it AT ALL! After making the biggest mistake of applying on to my face, my face started breaking out everywhere!

The fishy smell persisted on my skin for several hours after applying -- even after makeup on top -- so I had to toss this. I have other face oils that work well and don't smell so I couldn't see a good reason to keep it.

      "…read more Broke me out put whiteheads all over me! Only good for moisturizing the lips... ***First Time Every Returning a Sephora Product*** I've tried a lot of pricey skin serums and oils, and I'm here to tell you this stuff is either a gimmicky joke, or this brand has some serious quality-control breeches in their production pipeline, with bad-batches still lining the shelves of Sephora as of late December 2019. As a skincare aficionado, I was excited to try this stuff, especially because the price point seemed pretty low for a product allegedly containing a bunch of top-notch ingredients, including gold. Joke's on me... The moment I opened the bottle I knew something was wrong. It smelled like old, rancid canola oil that's sat lidless in the back of your cabinet for 4 months. I appreciate and use mostly fragrance-free products; I'm a huge fan of some of Biologique Recherche's stinky-but-effective serums. Consequently, I think I can tell the difference between smelling odd in a rancid way, versus smelling odd in simply a \"natural ingredient\" way. This stuff falls decidedly in the former category. Despite my smell-based instinct that something was off, I made the mistake of applying a small amount to my face. Unlike other high-quality oils, this did not seep into my skin to leave behind fresh, non-oily, dewy moisture. It seemed to stagnate on the surface of my skin, leaving behind an un-breathing, oily veneer. It felt so uncomfortable that I washed it off less than an hour later. In hindsight, this is probably why I only mildly broke out a day later, as opposed to the massive breaking out that some of the other reviewers experienced. I'm one of those consumers who gets that the performance of personal care products can be nuanced given skin-type and environmental factors, so my default isn't to immediately assume I've been scammed and leave a punitive review. However, this product was bad enough that I felt a moral obligation to return it in hopes that it might compel Sephora to flag any bad-batch or fraudulent marketing issues\n",

I used this on a regular basis for a couple weeks and sadly, my skin became very dried out. It hasn’t happened with other facial oils or lotions, so I am pretty sure this product has drying effects with regular use. I was never that impressed with the original essence and this is really no different. These are very over priced skincare products with very subpar payoff. They smell wonderful, they moisturize. However, so do many other products that cost a fraction of what these do. I’m sorry, but if you’re buying this for any other reason than a boujee purchase you’re a fool. Not worth the money. This sat on my skin and pilled when I put my moisturizer on. Too heavy and didn’t leave me radiant or hydrated at all. Got this on recommendation of an employee when looking for a less expensive option to the Caudalie Vinosource serum. This stuff is STICKY!!! It does not feel hydrating at all. Super disappointed and will be returning ASAP! I used this for a week on top of my regular routine and it did absolutely nothing. Maybe for summer if you have oily skin? But definitely does nothing for skin on the dryer side in colder months. My search continues. I love this line but this product did nothing for my skin. I wanted to love this, b/c YTTP is one of my all time favorite brands... but this wasn’t it sis. First off, it’s extremely sticky and for whatever reason it broke me out terribly. I’ve never had this issue with any other YTTP product, so I was surprised. It’s also EXPENSIVE so I would save your money and try something else. I used this for 3 weeks & no change. I recommend Tatcha for those that want more even & bright skin. Basically wasted my money on this product. I don’t think this serum did anything to help achieve my clear and glow skin. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This just doesn’t work. Have noticed no difference in blemishes when using this. I even applied it multiple times a day. Still nothing. Save your money. Made me super itchy which made me touch my face more than consequently my face broke out everywhere. This stuff doesn’t get rid of my pimples, all it does is make my face peel severely. I put it on three days ago and my skin is STILL peeling. This does NOTHINGGG. All it does is make the area of the blemish flaky and dry. It doesn’t reduce swelling or puffiness or semi cures the blemish at all. Do yourself a favor and buy the Mario badescu sulfur spot treatment instead- that works wonders and actually feels like you’re doing something to help a blemish - unlike this!!! So disappointed! Was so excited to try this but it was horrible for me. The product kept balling up no matter how much I rubbed it in. I literally would sit there for a full minute rubbing and it never stopped balling up and peeling. This product also broke me out soooooo bad, and I never break out. I have a zit maybe once a year or two, and this product gave me 5 break outs after only using it for 3 days. Glad I got a mini size to try before dropping a ton of money for the full size.\n",
      "…read more I NEVER write reviews, but this product IMMEDIATELY balls up on my skin upon application. (I got the mini version in a set.) Not worth it. Do not buy. It made my makeup slip off my face and added a grease like feel to my skin. Did not like at all. I used a sample of this when I was traveling as an alternative to my usual sunscreens (normally I reach for Supergoop or La Roche Posay). One use was enough to break me out really badly. I know this product is what caused it because I had not changed anything else about my routine in months. Instead of just dunking on this product and leaving it at that, I want to break down why it broke me out and why this formula isn't very good. First of all, it is formulated with SEVEN different fragrances. My skin can maybe occasionally handle a little bit of fragrance, but using more fragrances in your routine does increase the chances for irritation. Additionally, this product contains retinyl palmitate, an inactive form of vitamin A that isn't particularly safe for regular use, nor is it at all necessary to include in a sunscreen. It's entirely possible that the inclusion of this ingredient also contributed to my skin reacting poorly. I don't like giving bad reviews, but people deserve to know what is in their products and why they are potentially having a negative reaction to them. There are plenty of other clear sunscreens on the market that have much cleaner formulas (Supergoop comes to mind, as does Coola and Volition - by the way, I am not sponsored by any of these brands). I recommend purchasing one of those products, or one of many many others out there, instead.\n",

This is not a great retinol if you can even call it that, especially for the price. I really don’t understand all of the positive reviews. Received this product and it smelled rancid like it had been either tainted or old. Bought this instead from QVC where their inventory turns over quicker. I have oily skin and have great results with serums. This product gave me dry patches. Used 2 bottles and it did nothing for me but give me dry patches. Such a shame. I wanted to love this. This sulfur mask did not work for me. Unfortunately, I am in the smaller percentile where this mask did opposite of what it claimed. I broke out- still breaking out in places where I never had acne before. I am using All PTR products from the anti aging facial wash, to the gel exfoliator and green cooling mask.

Does is make my skin poreless? DEFINITELY NOT. If anything it brought my pores out more because of the way it dries. It made my makeup so cakey, and almost each time I tried it I ended up redoing my foundation. Overall, this is the worst primer i have ever tried. And the price tag is like ????

Given all the glowing reviews and the high price tag, I had great expectations for this product. It did exactly nothing for my skin - no glow, no refreshed look, no firmness, no impact at all. Total waste of money! This concealer doesn’t stay on my skin for more than 15 minutes. It looks for and has full coverage when you first put it on. However if you look in the mirror in and hour you look like you never put concealer on in the first place. I don’t understand how this is a product?? It just comes off immediately. This may be the worst makeup product I have ever used. Wanted so badly to love this product as I’m always looking for a good coverup for breakouts from time to time. After putting it on the blemish, the texture instantly becomes pealy as if my skins is dry and product basically falls off. At the very least I would hope this product at least would cover up the coloring/ redness of the blemish and it did not at all.\n",
      "…read more What a disappointment. Caviar it is not. This is a 10 percent peel. A nice lime smell. No difference. It is not worth 90 dollars for marketing jar, Beverly Hills address. This is sadly all hype and no innovation. More excess for the land fill. Shame on me. This did absolutely nothing for my skin. I wish I could return it, don't waste your money Does not work at all. Does not do anything do your face. Like, a t a l l !!! I have been using this product for about 6 months and I do not see any improvement. It also has a very strong smell I have combination skin with occasional hormonal breakout around chin. This one broke me out, on my cheeks and hormonal breakout worsen a bit. Already returned it. Unfortunately, I bought this for a mild acne issue on my shoulders, and after using this along with the after spray my acne got much much worse. I tried to keep using it hoping it would work but eventually I stopped, and as soon as I stopped using it it was much much less bad. The price is much too high to take this chance This didn't work for me at all. I wish I could return it. It will exfoliate, but that's about it. I get really bad acne break outs on my back and sometimes on my chest. I was hoping to find cleanser that can lessen my breakouts or even stop them, so I tried this one out. However it didn't really help much :(( but I'm willing to try out new products! I found this product to make me break out more as well as start to break out in areas of my back that I’d never had issues before. I tried both using this is in daily routine and also with 1 to 2 day breaks between use and neither of those approaches made the product more effective for me. I was really excited for this product based off the overwhelming amount of positive reviews, but this wasn’t a win for me.\n",
      "…read more I got this with high hopes and it just doesn’t work. I got a spin brush to use with it and it doesn’t work. It’s over priced for what it is since it barely lasts 3 weeks. Don’t waste your time using it. Purchased a while back and unfortunately never got around to writing a review. This body wash was not worth the price I paid, it didn’t work in the slightest bit. I have minimal acne on my back and chest, I read the great reviews on it so I figured I’d give it a try. I was so excited when I purchased but was ultimately disappointed after the weeks of me using it because it lacked any benefit. Would not purchase again, not worth it.\n",
      "…read more I wanted to really like this product, but after 2 weeks of continual use, I noticed it started to make my face sting. Then small zits and dry patches of skin started to form. I stopped using it but it evolved into a full-on facial rash. I had to go see my dermatologist in order to calm down the flare-up. Just not good with my sensitive skin! Not a product for me. It smelled so nice and I liked how it was easy to apply but it had to impact on my skin. I returned it and I never return things but it felt like such a waste of money. This really isn’t a review I just need to share that I feel like this product is a waste of money. I always thought so highly of PTR's product line, especially his masks. However, when I tried this product, it made my acne worse than it already was! I used it as directed, and although it didn't cause my skin to burn, I would wake up with more zits than I had the night before. I will never ever get this product again, as it does not work for my skin which is oily combination and acne prone I’ve taken these for years and they used to work very well. My skin was bright and my acne went away and I would get compliments on my skin. If ever I would stop taking them, my skin would break out so I could tell that these were working. However, the formula has changed more recently and the tablets are smaller and look different. These stopped working for me and my skin is now breaking out terribly even taking the full dose, multiple bottles in. Extremely disappointing considering the price point. I do not plan to continue to purchase.\n",
      "…read more I have non-cystic, hormonal acne and I'm on my third bottle of this because I needed to try it for at least three months to see the results. This unfortunately hasn't done anything for my skin. No difference whatsoever, but I'm sure the vitamins in the supplement are helpful for optimal health anyway. Still disappointed because the price point is high. I was a little disappointed because I’ve tried everything from drug store acne products to proactiv and none have worked for my skin. I’ve suffered with acne since I was about 14, now 27 and only 1 product has really helped me, Benzaclin. I haven’t been able to visit a dermatologist but I intend to. I really had hope this product would work but I’ve had better results applying aloe Vera to my face. Yes, I was consistent and showed no results. Good luck to you all, but it really didn’t work for me.\n",
      "…read more I have been using this product for many years and it did work for my acne. Recently Murad decided to change the ingredients they lowered the dose and took some stuff out including vitamin B2. I’m very disappointed now they don’t work anymore my acne is not going away Broke me out with tiny red bumps all over my face , Mostly in places I never break out in like my forehead..sooooooooo it’s a big huge no & a pass for me Didn't work i used it fir two week I never had severe acne. I just always had hormonal acne around my chin which was finally starting to clear up. I decided to order these to see if I could finally have perfect skin, but it made me break out EVERYWHERE. They weren't like regular pimples. They were tiny little bumps all over my face and my arms, and they were very red. Took about a month for it to clear up. Be cautious. Pricey and does not work at all ,I purchased the full Murad 30 day kit along with this .My breakouts are getting worse ,why would you overcharge a product that does not work at all ,it made my face worse ! I have been using this product for about a month now and really do not see any change or improvement in the redness in my skin. This did absolutely nothing to calm my redness! It was not worth the hefty price tag. I wanted to love! So bad, that I kept using after I seen the signs. I’ve never been one to break out. Now I have red blotches all over my face Expensive, wasteful packaging, and zero results. Used for over a month and literally no change. This product doesn’t work, was a waste of money. I’m not sure why Clinique’s products have gone down the drain. Didn’t work at all form me. None of the blackheads disappeared as I scrubbed it on :( was returned no difference. Too much for what little it does. you can find one similar that would work better at CVS Comes with a weird applicator that does not work with applying the product. It does heat up a little bit, but delivers 0 results... Such a waste of money. This eye serum did mot work for me. The first two uses it seemed fine -no changes but no issues. The last time I used it I woke up the next morning to puffy irritated eyes. My under eyes looked worse! I wish I could rate this product. It was never delivered and after inquiring twice, I've never heard back regarding my order. I’m not sure if it improved my skin but it was sticky and made my face shiny. I will not buy again I hated the bottle so much I couldn’t even give the product a fair review- terrible design. The first one I received leaked all over the box. The replacement was packed like a Faberge egg- still leaked. Cannot travel with it, totally impractical. I’ll stick with the Rose. I decided to take a break from my usual serum, the Sunday Riley Luna Night Oil and was recommended this Resveratrol Lift Firming Serum. After my 3rd application of this stuff my skin felt and looked horrible! I'm talkin' fine lines and dry patches that became even more noticeable under make up. I waited a few days for my skin to go back to normal and returned it. This is a NO for me and my skin! My skin breaks out every time I use this product. I’ll finish the tube, but will not purchase again. I’ll stick w/ their acne and wrinkle reducing serum. Pretty indifferent with this product. The only thing it seemed to do for me was make my skin feel textured. It didn’t seem to help my breakouts (especially cystic acne) at all. It didn't do anything for my acne at all. I like the light gel texture of it. I used this product for a few weeks on my acne and it did not make a difference on inflammation, irritation, or actual size of my acne. It's an expensive product and I have found a much better and cheaper alternative as a spot treatment. I was recommended this product by a lady at Sephora. The product did not work for me at all! I started breaking out even more. It did not heal my breakouts even a tad bit. I wish I could return it. I wanted to try this out due to the reviews. I’ve been using it religiously for months with ZERO results. Pretty disappointed considering how expensive it is. Didn’t feel any allergic reaction during the 30 min I kept it on, but once I washed it off w water I saw my skin was very blotchy and red Tried it because Jeffree star but did not work. Dried my skin out and absolutely did not work. Absolutely does not work. I’m pretty sure the other reviews are coming from the company itself. The only thing this product is great for, is leaving your skin smelling like sulfur for the rest of the day. There’s so many other products that are far less expensive, that actually work. Didn't help with acne. You can find same ingredients for less money I don’t see what the hype is all about. The cream does nothing and smells strongly of perfume. I purchased this about 3 months ago and mixed with a Vitamin C serum I had from Garnier. I used every night and noticed no change at all. When I used it by itself, it was really sticky. I did not see any difference. I wish it worked for me!! Did absolutely nothing. I used this, as advised, for 6 months. The only fading I saw in my pigmentation no change outside of what is normal. Maybe this will work for your skin, but it just really didn’t for me. I tried this because I like a lot of kiehl’s products but this one did not moisturize or hydrate and seemed to sit on the skin vs sinking in. It felt more like a smoothing primer than a skincare item. I have very sensitive skin but i wanted a little bit more moisture. This didn't work for me it broke me out into little bumps. It feels like a primer and not like a serum. Used four weeks 0 results waste of money Does not even soften the skin like many high end serums I don't know what I was thinking when I spent $110 on this product. I wish I decided to return this earlier, but at this point, they wouldn't accept it back. I haven't noticed anything different while using this serum (I used it regularly). Nothing at all!!! Even when I would put it on my face. You usually feel/see something, you at least see you have a product on your face. But, with this, it's like I put air on my face. When you touch the skin-you feel nothing. No softness, firmness, oiliness/dry skin, nothing! When you wake up next morning, same. I decided to finish the bottle, just because I payed a lot, and couldn't return it, and who knows, a miracle might happen. Although, I wasn't expecting a miracle when I bought it, I expected something! But no. I feel so stupid. Please save your money, and do not invest in this product, because it will not do anything for you.\n",

Had to moisturize big time after using. The fragrance is nice though. I really liked how this product went on and the coverage it provided. But it was too greasy and heavy. It caused acne/breakouts. I have sensitive, acne-prone, combination-dry skin. It dried out my skin and made my tiny pores appear huge. I could see it crumbling and moving around on my face throughout the day. It's a shame because so many people love this stuff, but my bare skin looks better. I'm going back to my Fresh renewed hope in a jar skin tint. When I first put this on my face, it felt like velvet. It feels good putting it on your skin, but I quickly became aware that it never fully soaks into my skin. It is absolutely terrible under foundation. I have tried multiple times now, some where I’ve tried waiting 15 min after putting on the moisturizer to then put on foundation. It always pills into little balls and does not sit smoothly on my face. I’ve tried with the too faced born this way foundation, makeup forever ultra HD foundation and the Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation. It happens with all of them and is very disappointing. I will continue to use this moisturizer on days where I won’t be wearing foundation, but I will not repurchase this product.\n",
      "…read more Made me break out a lot and would leave my skin looking full and no shine. The name makes this sound like a powerhouse but it is extremely light and had pretty much no effect on my dry skin. Probably an ok product for someone in their 20s who wants a very light-touch moisturizer, because it absorbs quickly and disappears. moisturizer does not keep hydration on the face for very long. Would not reorder. Have used much better in the past. This product-to me- wasn’t great. It does NOT layer well with other products, unless completely dry, and no one has time for that. It balls up really badly even if you go over with another layer of the same cream. It’s so fussy to use. Usually fresh is so good, but this one let me down. Doesn’t seem particularly moisturizing either for how thick it is. Won’t be repurchasing. I feel as if this moisturizer does a decent job moisturizing but every single time I use it, I break out. Unfortunately I bought it over the summer last year and didn’t start using it again until recently so it’s too late for me to return it. I would either purchase the smaller option of this moisturizer or get a sample if possible to test it on your skin. The fragrance in this is a little too strong for my liking as well. Purchased this moisturizer to pair with the Fresh Rose Hydration serum and the combo just didn’t work for me. The moisturizer on its own also did not provide enough hydration and my skin felt tight and dry even after applying. Granted with most moisturizers, at least for me, I have to pair them with another product to help with dryness around my chin/cheeks.The smell is nice! The product matched my skin tone perfectly, but the coverage wasn't moist enough for my skin and it created dry PACTHES on my face (an employee from the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua, Nh told me it would be enough to hydrate my skin). For anyone who has mild-super dry skin, I wouldn't recommend this product to you. This does not blend at all! It leaves patches on my skin where the makeup will not adhere no matter what I do. It also appears super greasy by the end of the day, and I do NOT have oily skin. While it is very moisturizing, after a week of using it, my pores are super congested and I have more blackheads than ever. Perhaps it’s better with a small amount just on patches and not the whole face, but my skin is so dry I needed the moisture everywhere. This didn’t do anything noticeably good for my skin. Only thing it did was sting when I put it on. Other than that it was an expensive cream. I gave it to my mom who seems to enjoy it. Just take note if you have sensitive skin. I have a trial size of this and although it is very moisturizing, it’s not my fav and not worth the price point in my opinion. It claims that it doesn’t leave your face greasy but it does and it doesn’t sit well under makeup. If you use this, use it before bed. I also have to agree on the smell, it doesn’t smell great. I would say that this moisturizer was actually very drying for me. I have oily/combination skin. I was recommended this product while searching for a tinted moisturizer because Philosophy has discontinued theirs. After my first use I strongly considered returning because I hate the texture and feel of this product. However I have noticed that it stays in place all day which is rare as I have oily skin. I won't be returning it but I don't think I'll buy it again. I don't like how flaky my skin looks when I use this and the texture is truly awful. I don't understand how it can be oil-free when it feels so oily and siliconey. I'm very torn on this product because it does make my skin look nice, I'm just not a fan of how it applies. I also don't find it buildable at all. Kudos to Tarte for making a tinted primer with SPF that doesn't feel like SPF but this just isn't for me.\n",
      "…read more Looks good, covers redness lightly but it settles into my expression lines on my forehead which I do not like. I received this as a sample with one of my purchases. If you are very light like I am this will be too dark for you. Also more of a yellow undertone when I’m more pink. The coverage is actually pretty good if it was the right color. But instead of a smoothing feeling after application it feels sticky. It's such a lovely and nourishing texture that I really wanted to love it, but it pills something awful! If you're only using it at night, it should be fine; but if you're trying to use this in the morning and don't have an extra half hour while rushing to work to wait for it to settle before applying sunscreen, it's the worst! It clumps in awful gray spots that look like lint. I hope they find a way to fix that, because I would love the feel of it otherwise.\n",

It also gave me more pimples. Gel is not as hydrating as the original formula was. Too bad... It's probably more suitable for younger, oily skin. I wanted to love this, but I had to return it after a month. I used the goodnight glow and the serum together and the first couple weeks I saw no difference what so ever, then I started to break out and even got red bumps/breakouts on my face.

It didn't fade my dark spots. It didn't give me an everlasting glow. The texture was good though nice and thick. Overall this cream didn't do anything it claimed to do.

Also, when I opened the cap the bottom lip followed with it and the oil got everywhere so I returned it to the store, hoping it wouldn’t happen again. I went to open the new bottle this morning and the lip of the cap broke AGAIN. It is very frustrating when you spend almost $50 on a product and the cap keeps malfunctioning! Now it does not close properly and it’s very aggravating. Hope the oil doesn’t “go bad”.\n",

So I can't speak to effects but the smell is so awful I don't think I'm going to be able to finish the jar. this like... doesn't do anything. i'm dry/combo and on a bare face it makes me look shiny for a few minutes then it's no noticeable difference. it does even less to my makeup. literally doesn't make my makeup look any different whether i spritz it before or after. also, two spritzes for your whole face? i need at least four/five to cover everything, especially if i'm wearing foundation, and it's tiny as if it's some gold in the bottle... so i'm halfway finished with it and have used it maybe 5/6 times. i wanna love tatcha and this packaging is to die for but the actual product? hard pass. i see better results with a jumbo 7 dollar bottle of evian face mist from tj maxx.\n",
      "…read more I was really hoping to like this moisturizer since I used the Vitamin C moisturizer all summer and loved it. But after three days of using this product, my skin has never felt so dry. My forehead and nose were flaking and I had to apply another moisturizer on top to help. I have very dry skin in the winter, so I will probably revisit this product in the summer. Overall not a good buy if you have very dry skin. I have dry skin/ combo skin in the summer. Tried this moisturizer out, it wasn’t anything special. Nothing to really spend $40 on. Its just a basic moisturizer. Doesn’t do much for your skin. The claims are helps with evening your tone (not really) help with texture ( nope ) its extremely light weight.

This product broke me out in my dry areas and made my oily areas sooo red and sensitive. No improvement, just irritation. I got this on sale because my skin is so dry from Retin-A. There’s no way it’s worth $75! It provides moisture for the day but putting it on feels awful. Very tight/dry feeling when applying it on my skin. It also has a horrible ‘chemical’ smell. Get a sample before paying the price for the full size! It also only has a shelf life of 6 months, you’ll never finish it before it goes bad Feels good on the skin, not too heavy but does moisturize well. However, the next morning I noticed small whiteheads around my nose and on the cheeks and forehead after using this. Will return. Love rose water (both for its scent and its benefits) which is what attracted me to this, along with reviews. Unfortunately, it caused me to break out (mild) and seemed a little too heavy.

The biggest positive however, is that it did not react negatively to my skin. It did provide the moisture needed without being greasy or sticky and it sunk into my skin quite well. Didn't break me out, but really didn't do much either. A little goes a long way and I'm just now finishing the jar.

Mine is defective and will not allow for the product to be “screwed up” I enjoyed it a few mornings after late nights and liked the cooling sensation but it leaves a tacky residue that was not appealing to me This is not worth the price. It isn't moisturizing and feels like it just sits on the skin and doesn't absorb. I’m using their serum version for night time and this was just too heavy to add on day or night. Perhaps in winter? Moisturizes well enough, but it broke my skin out. i've been really loving the milk makeup hydro grip primer and when i ran out i decided i would try this, because why not- i ended up buying my milk one again because this one made my dry skin really flakey! i see how it might work for people with normal or combo skin but it just didn't work for me. This felt so nice on my oily skin, like a cooling lotion that made my skin smooth as glass. It made my foundation go on like a dream. However after a while my skin started to itch. When I took my foundation off at the end of the day my face was covered in tiny breakouts. My foundation looked flawless but my skin hated it so I wound buy again. I would recommend this for oily skin. I didn't purchase this item on Sephora. It does not help my foundation last longer at all. The only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it works fine as a day-time moisturizer for me. Not for oily/combination skin.

I’ve never had this experience with any other cleanser! I tried avoiding the mouth area and it still happened and I’d have to spit it out. I also wasn’t impressed with its ability to remove eye makeup, which was my main reason for buying an oil cleanser.

This cream is extremely heavy, I unfortunately found continued use to make me break out and leave with me with a very oily face. Not good for sensitive skin. I enjoyed the original so was hoping that this would be just as great while also adding more SPF into my routine. The smell gets to be overwhelming once I apply it, thankfully it goes away but those first 5-10 min is intense. It slightly burns my eyes, which I guess is due to the essential oils. Most importantly this does not hydrate my dry skin and it is not cosmetically elegant. Applying foundation over this moisturizer leads to a patchy application that clings to the moisturizer and cakes up.\n",

Cons: dries out skin at times, runs out quickly, causes breakouts, and actually made my skin uneven at times (probably because it dried out certain areas of my face) Also, I saw a ton of other reviewers saying that this toner doesn’t contain alcohol or water, but beware it actually contains both! I’m glad that this seems to work for other people’s skin, but not mine.

Cons: Super drying. I feel like it’s aging my skin, as the alcohol in it just zaps any life out of it (and I have very oily skin). While it cleans it the gunk, it isn’t necessary. I find that If i actually double cleanse and properly remove my makeup I don’t need a toner to do the job. It’s just extra money wasted on a step that could’ve been done with an effective cleanser. But if you really need a toner and love the exfoliation, I’d recommend finding one that doesn’t have alcohol in it. You might think it’ll work fabulously with oily skin, but it’s honestly just plain drying.

I didn’t experience and break outs or negative reactions using this. If you are sensitive to scents or don’t like using skincare products that have a scent, this isn’t for you. My complaint is that it doesn’t remove all my makeup. It doesn’t remove eyeliner or mascara completely and I’ve used other cleansers that do the job. I double cleanse, of course, but I do have high expectations when using cleansing balms. The ingredients in this aren’t luxurious to me and not worth the high price tag.

But once I had it on my face I didn’t feel the moisture nor the satisfied feeling that it’s clean. If I don’t put toner right away it made my skin dry out. I returned it. Made me break out the first week of using it. Everyone has different skin types but it personally didn't work well for me. I broke out even more with this which i'm sad cause my friend loves it. My skin is usually clear just tiny bumps, but since I used this I got a big pimple that won't go away. And it irritated my boyfriend skin on first use. The consistency is terrible. It’s like putting water on my face. I asked for a cleanser that could help with my acne and this product does not do that. Worst Investment.

This product is okay to use in the winter when you just want a pick me up but not for a daily cleanser. I tried this product in the gift set and wasn’t impressed. It didn’t break out my sensitive skin, but it also didn’t really do anything positive. I didn’t feel refreshed or cleansed at all after using it. I would not purchase this again. It smella horrible!! I actually have to hold my breath to apply it! Not what I expected at all. I was so excited to try this cleanser after sampling a few KIEHLS products. I loved the fact it was daily use but also an exfoliating cleanser. The truth is, it doesn’t completely remove your makeup even after 2 applications, lathering & rinsing. I always have concealer left around my eyes, and I feel like it just pushes my foundation around my face. You don’t feel squeaky clean at all. I was disappointed with this product, being that it’s such a large bottle of it too and for the price point. Buy yourself some Tatcha, Deep cleanse if you want just that.\n",

It left it scratched and raw for days. This is good for a 2x a week usage. I am giving it 2 stars since it’s good for acne, but there is many better exfoliators than this... While I did enjoy this product at first (you’ll feel squeaky clean and baby smooth after your first try), it is extremely drying and strips the skin with frequent use. After a couple of uses (this is marketed as a daily cleanser) I started to notice how tight and dry my skin felt and I’m as oily as can be. Also, the texture feels more like something you’d put your skin through once a week as an exfoliating treatment, not as a part of your daily cleansing routine. However, I wouldn’t recommend physical exfoliators anyways, just google micro-tears and maybe you’ll move onto chemical exfoliators like I did. Try at your own risk but this product can definitely be rough on skin. That, combined with its price tag and possibly ruining your skin in the long run, I’d steer clear.\n",

But trying it at home, the scrub was way harsh on my skin :( those little beads just felt so rough I bought these wipes based off the numerous great reviews but it is not worth the money. I bought these thinking one wipe would remove my full face of makeup but I have to use at least 3. I use Estée Lauder double wear foundation and Lancôme big mascara.

The wipes themselves are nice, but I can't recommend them unless you like relying on a product that gets more and more expensive every few months. I understand that prices have to go up somewhat over time, but in the past year continuous price hikes have made it so an already pricey item has now almost doubled in cost– they used to be $13 not that long ago, around this time last year they were $15, and now they're up to $23 for ten cloths?!

Not worth it.. especially if you have acne prone skin. Pick something else. This toner smells great but made me break out with tiny pimples... I think this toner is ONLY for people with acne... If you have clear skin it just dries your skin out which then makes your face produce more oil which leads to said breakouts. This made my skin so sticky, and caused my face to heat up. It was quite an uncomfortable feeling, almost as if my skin was highly irritated. Will not be repurchasing. I wanted to like this product because it was recommended to me by an esthetician, but it didn't work long-term for me. It seemed to do a good job of removing makeup, but there are some ingredients in there that did not agree with my skin. I started getting an itchy, red rash after a few days of using it nightly. I know, I know, I should have patch-tested first! But I didn't. So I returned it. I had high expectations since I really like Philosophy products in general but this fell flat. It doesn't remove regular regular mascara without a fight, and leaves me feeling tacky in general after cleansing my face. I just used the first wipe of the package. It smells like it has fragrance added. I don't really care for the scent AND I avoid fragrance on my skin, as I have contact dermatitis off and on, plus other sensitivities. And even if I didn't, it just doesn't seem to be a good idea to put fragrance on your face. Anyway, I checked the ingredients and don't see fragrance. Not sure what this smell is, but it doesn't work for me. Didn’t care for the scent at all and barely removed any makeup. too gentle for me but smells really good. i used it for about three months and my skin actually got worse. luckily it did not dry out my skin, but it did become extremely red It definitely makes your skin feel clean after washing, but seems to overdry skin and does not help with the appearance or size of acne Leaves face soft but it broke out and clogged my acne prone, combination skin. I donc really like this product. I have a dry sensitive skin and this made me breakout I found it drying. It doesn't remove all of my eye make-up and leaves behind smudges under my eye that I can't get off, and you have to rinse it off with water afterwards. I prefer Lancome but until they quit testing on animals I will continue my search for a cruelty free eye make-up remover. I bought this cleanser, not knowing anything about the line. first time I used it my skin felt great, clean and soft, I couldn't wait to use it the next day. 3 days later after using it only at night my skin was so dry and flaky I had to stop using it. I have combination acne prone skin. It's more for oily skin in my opinion. I bought this as a replacement for the mud to foam cleanser in the pump. It is not the same and is disappointing compared to it’s predecessor. I would use it after taking my makeup off with an oil cleanser and between the two, my skin would feel amazing and I could see that the grime was literally knocked out of my pores. Not the same results with this formula. It’s nothing special. HORRIBLE smell. It makes me want to throw up. I literally gagged when using it. The product does what it says but definitely get the correct cleanser for your skin type. I got the normal one but I should have bought the one for sensitive skin types as the normal one dries me out a bit. However what took this down two whole stars was the packaging. Wow.

You have to work really hard to get it to lather and the quality does not match up to the price Being that I just turned 30, I’ve noticed my skin changing. Wanting to add hydration and brighten my skin, for preventative measures I switched from Clarifying Toner to this. I did see some improvements over a few days as far as tighter pores, and brighter skin, my problem was it wasn’t cleaning my pores either.

I felt like I was just applying something and nothing was happening.. plus for the amount i got and the price, I could get a 15 dollar one (the Mario badescu with 8 fluid oz ) that has more and you feel it working right way than the mini version of this that is 1 oz and lasted me maybe 2 weeks.. that would accumulate.\n",
      "…read more Like the concept of MILK toner, the only thing about this one is it gets dry after a certain time, maybe because of the compact size. Wish the moisture/product stays longer. I started using this for about a week and made no difference. I mainly bought it to help my acne but didn’t work at all. Also the product kept falling out of its container. Not worth it. the white residue it leaves if u even try to spread the product around with your fingers just feels wrong. it feels moisturizing but doesn’t feel like a toner I don't know what I was expecting... The packaging is super cute but the product doesn't do anything for me and it leaves a sticky feeling Product is very sticky. I didn’t like it at all. It does have a good smell but I wouldn’t buy it again. Not terrible but doesn’t really do anything. It might work for some people but I’m not sure what it would actually do. I don’t know why, but a couple weekS into using this and my skin is freaking out. I’ve had more breakouts in the last week than I did in my teens. I really like the normal to dry formula of this toner, but I was starting to get a bit oily, so when I ran out I thought I’d try the combo/oily formula because that’s what my skin’s usually... man I was wrong. Also, wth fragrance!? This formula compared to the Normal is so heavily scented that it’s off-putting.\n",

I will be returning this product. I don’t find this product particularly helpful in reducing sebum production. I also don’t think the active ingredients are concentrated enough to make a difference, even after religious use. Does it balance your skin’s pH after cleansing? I’m not convinced. In my humble opinion, you are better off using a toner that’s more generous with AHAs and/or BHA. Not sure if this toner did anything, but definitely not worth the price. Maybe I had high expectations because of the brand fame and comparing the price, I’d rather buy a drugstore one for the same purpose It is an okay product, I LOVED it for balancing and oil control at first, but then after using it for a few weeks straight it started drying out my skin really bad. I have combination skin so it worked fine in some areas but the alcohol in the toner was very drying in others. I wouldn’t recommend it Residue!! I have used several micellar cleansers and this one leaves way more residue than any other. Not a fan for my sensitive breakout prone skin. Not very hydrating. Face feels dry again a few minutes after spraying. This toner makes it difficult to apply face cream and primer. Removes makeup as well as any oil cleanser but caused my nighttime serums and moisturizer to pill up. I didn’t like this one at all. I had the one in the white bottle with a pump but they discontinued it. It was much better! This one turned into an oil but then it didn’t emulsify into a foam and then I couldn’t get the oil off my face with water. I had to use a cotton pad to get it off and the makeup was still on my face. So disappointed! Hate the smell, peels off my face. Def not my fav from first aid beauty. Product was fine, didn’t cause breakouts and didn’t sensitize my skin when used appropriately. Results were average. The pump on the bottle broke and product came out the sides so I returned it...only to have the new one do the same thing. Better products and better packaging out there. Purchased months ago and have given up trying to force myself to apply this unpleasant formula. I'm picky about ingredient lists because my skin is easily irritated and this passed muster. Unfortunately, everything else is a disaster. It's sticky and thick, doesn't absorb well, then pills whether alone or under foundation. Who wants Elmer's glue all over their face? It's very yellow which for fairer skin tones might actually show on the face. The round, smooth, twist-up packaging is poorly designed.....if my hands are even a little bit moist they keep slipping and I can't get the thing open! Since when are people's hands bone-dry in the middle of skincare application?\n",

It's heavily perfumed and gave me a headache. Returned it after one use. Too bad. Super sad because I was hoping this product would work miracles for me based off the reviews I read. I definitely havent used it long enough to see any improvements in my acne scars, but I find that this product is making me break out more than before I was using it! I am not sure if I should be using it since I still have active acne too. I try to avoid my areas of active acne and just apply to the areas with the scars, but I get the feeling the rollerball accidentally touches the acne and then is spreading the bacteria around the different parts of my face. I will probably return and try something from another brand\n",

I prefer the first aid radiance beauty pads. I wanted to return this serum but it was outside my return time. In all honesty, I can't give the efficacy of this product a true review, because I haven't made it that far. I am really disappointed with this product upon my first use, because the 2nd ingredient is Dimethicone. Since this indicates it's for evening use only, I put it on directly after my toner, as I tend to like to use my actives as close to the skin as is possible. However because this is so loaded with silicone, nothing will layer nicely over it, and I ended up with it pilling terribly when I tried to moisturize over it. Silicone DOES NOT belong in night time skincare. I don't need a silky smooth feeling before I go to bed. Under makeup? Heck yeah. But if I can't use an oil and cream overtop of this, it completely defeats the purpose for me. I'm sad I wasted a promo code to get this, and I most certainly won't be buying the full size.

I haven’t had luck with the mushroom ingredients. I don’t see a big difference in my skin, specifically my pores, when I use them. Very heavily scented and if you take apart the bottle, it’s 75% packaging and 25% actual product. Looks bigger than it is so i was shocked when I was done the bottle so quickly. Not worth the extremely high price. I was hoping this would clear my hormonal acne but didn’t notice a difference. Still had the acne after using the whole tub. Possible the salicylic acid doesn’t work for me since I’ve used other products with it and haven’t seen a difference. Their facial radiance pads are much better. I recommend you purchase them instead. Okay, so I bought this product because I've never had a retinol/retinoid before and Susan Yara from Mixed Makeup recommended this specific product. I love me some Susan so I bought the product. I am NOT a fan. I opened the bottle and was blasted with fragrance. Like...this stuff is POTENT. I don't like having any fragrance on my skin because I'm acne-prone and slightly sensitive. I probably should have read the ingredients closer than just trusting Susan lol. Smells horrifically synthetic and I'm honestly anxious to put this stuff on my skin. I used it for a few weeks before getting a prescription for differin cream. I didn't notice any difference while using it but my skin definitely didn't improve. I'm sure this product is great for a lot of people, but I am not one of those people!!

If you have sensitive skin at all I would not reccommend this product. I ended up returning it which bummed me out. 2 weeks already and didn't notice any change. FYI, don't like the smell of it. Loved the product but vitamin c isn’t as strong when is exposed to air and the packaging is awful for the price. Bought 2 and both times my dropper was falling apart. Returned product. If packaging was more vitamin c friendly would definitely repurchase. But your paying a lot for a product that is degrading due to packaging I really wanted to love this product but the rosemary scent is so overwhelming to me it gives me a headache. Other than slightly reducing the redness around my nose, this serum was way overpriced for the lack of any significant results. I would not recommend and will not be buying again. Also should have just returned it. This stuff is a major disappointment so far. The reviews are all super, but the serum is not. For the very high price of a one ounce bottle, I expected at least some results after a few weeks. No miracles, of course, but something? Anything? I always regret straying from my standard Caudalie/PTR regimen. This serum is sticky, and stays that way. All day or night, STICKY. I live near a large, polluted city on the East Coast, so with Dior’s magical claims of detoxifying and protecting skin from ‘external aggressors’ like pollution, I at least expected a very clean feeling to my skin. But in the several weeks that I used it two times daily, my skin got noticeably worse! I am over 50 but have pretty good skin. Just fighting the age, with fine lines, larger pores, and a bit of leftover sun damage. But when I used the Dior serum, my skin actually broke out with cheek acne. Haven’t seen that in 40 years! I flipped my vanity mirror to Magnify, and was dismayed to see that it looked like my skin was sort of disintegrating. THAT has never happened to me. I guess fear of aging will make you do stupid things like pay $100 for one ounce of something you haven’t sampled before. It makes me feel even worse that this is sort of a pre-serum serum...it was almost bound to fail. Once again, I kept the faith and kept using it to give it a chance, so now I likely can’t return it. (I gave this 2 stars strictly for the excellent packaging. Dark, heavy glass bottle; nice smooth-action pump; secure lid.) When an expensive, designer skincare product makes your skin worse than it’s ever been, you know it is definitely not the ONE.\n",

It only helps a little mattigying, but does nothing with the pores size This really did nothing for my pores. I went through most of the bottle but didn’t notice a difference. This refinisher doesn't minimize your pores, but it creates a mask full of silicons on your skin, so it can't breath. It doesn't clog pores though. I guess it can be used as a make up primer but used alone as itself it does nothing to pores neither has good benefits (like antioxidants and etc) for your skin. Having used numerous vitamin C products in the past (skinceuticals, drunk elephant, dr.dennis gross, etc.), this serum is a very gentle, inoffensive product that no doubt will work beautifully with sensitive skin or for people who are new to vitamin C. That being said, this was personally too gentle for me, and I did not see any changes to my skin. However, I also did not break out or react adversely to this product, so perhaps this is an issue of my own skin needing a bit more oomph. Also, Ole is not the only brand guilty of promoting this, but collagen molecules are simply too large to be absorbed via the skin, so do take any topical collagen claims with a grain of salt! If you are looking to boost your own collagen production, consider taking collagen supplements orally instead, and not relying on a skincare product's claims to do so.\n",

However, I’ve been using this about a month and am finding my face still extremely dry. I feel this firms my skin more than it hydrated, and it can often burn when applied to extremely dry areas. The smell is also not great. Not worth the price and will be trying to return. This did not feel hydrating at all. I have extremely dry skin and my face felt kind of tight when I would put this on. A little brightness in the beginning maybe, but not much difference at all after a 3.4 fl oz bottle was done. What a waste. Maybe these topicals can’t help late 40s skin I think La Mer makes some of the best skincare products on the market and I had high hopes for this one, mainly for uneven pigmentation and scaring, but if fell short especially when considering the price tag.

I feel like there are other “concentrate” formulas from other brands that work better and for a quarter of the price. Apply quite nice, but used an entire bottle and did not do anything to my skin. Did not like it since it caused me to break out. I have tried other similar products and they didnt irritate my skin. Had to return it. I really wanted this to work and help my sunspots.

It seemed to do more harm than good. This stuff SMELLS like straight alcohol when you apply it. Once you get over that smell it smells like sulfur. You might as well just slap 70% isopropyl alcohol because it’s the same straight smell. Although this did help reduce the acne, it’s not a miraculous treatment. It takes AT LEAST two days for this stuff to target and treat the acne, it’s not over night. You won’t visibly see results until days later. You’re better off using tea tree oil because it’s naturally derived and has better anti bacterial benefits. Although tea tree oil stings and is strong sometimes, this EradiKate treatment is just as painful if not worse. It stings just as bad and it’s just not as effective as people are making it out to be.\n",

Otherwise, I don't feel like it's been doing anything positive. In fact, my pores look larger (which is a side effect some clay masks have, so I've been told belatedly). The smell, too, puts me off.

This serum is incredibly gentle and enjoyable to use, making it a luxurious (self care) addition to your skincare routine. However, if you are truly looking to fight hyper-pigmentation/texture concerns or even out and brighten your skin tone, I would recommend a different serum with more potent active ingredients. Pitera and niacinamide are the first few ingredients listed for this product, which is reassuring -- I do not doubt that over years and years of consistent use, your skin will very slowly and subtly transform with this serum.

So far, one week in, I haven't seen any skin deep results where it's cleared out any old sunspots or dark areas, it feels like it's mostly a party trick with the glitter in the serum. If you have oily skin this might make your skin look a bit shinier because of the glitter in the serum. I will continue to use because I think if I use it minimally it can work well as a highlighter. The dropper applicator is also kind of weird because it's just not the easiest thing to use and I'm concerned that I'm gonna be wasting a lot of product when I get to the end of it.

I usually love PTR products so I was super excited to try this out. I have combo-semi sensitive acneic skin so my skin needs the hydration. I really wanted to love this product. It feels so light on the skin, mixes well with other ingredients and you really don't need a lot to go a long way. Only thing is, I did not find it really quenched my dehydrated skin. I went through the entire bottle and really didn't see a difference. Save your 60$.\n",
      "…read more Initially felt cooling on my skin but overall did absolutely nothing for it; if anything, it made my skin actually feel dried-out. Back to LaMer...and dang it, I was trying to save money :( I hope it works for others, I just have difficult skin, I guess. my face is still shiny, but not as shiny. Also, I feel like it doesn't help diminish size of pores. Lastly, my foundation and concealer don't want to stay on my face when I have this primer on. Overall, I would recommend if you have a problem with shiny skin, but it doesn't completely remove the shine as I had hoped. No long term effects seen with this product. I am pretty oily around my forehead and nose, but really dry around my cheeks, eyes, chin, and around my lips. As others have mentioned, the hydration provided by this product alone is not enough to keep my skin hydrated. Not very impressed. No noticeable effect on the texture or look of my skin. Not that hydrating. Not worth the price. I have acne scarring and medium combination skin. My concerns are oil control, redness, and scarring. I was hoping the water serum would help with oil control but I really don't feel like this serum does anything for my skin. Seems to just make my breakouts worse. Maybe this formula works for some people, but clearly my skin reacts badly. Only giving it two stars because the color matching / concealing IS actually good. I was disappointed. I wanted to love this but, first of all the smell of the lotion was extremely potent and gave me a headache which I am prone to. When I put it on I used a pea size squeeze and made sure to be gentle and even. I waited for the instant feel of hydration almost 10 mins :) I didnt feel very hydrated for the price of 200 my face better feel something immediately. I wanted to love this but, not worth the money. More to come on the eye concentrate.\n",
      "…read more I like this product and always receive compliments when I wear it. I get told my skin looks brighter or I look fresh, however, the texture is sticky and does not sit well on the skin Works ok, but horrible smell - there are better vitamin C serums, like Ole Henriksen, that work amazing, have better feel, and don't smell. Also, the packaging is deceiving as the bottle is large, but if you look, it's only half full and 1 ounce. Ole Henriksen is same or less cost, works amazing, but 2 ounces. not worth your money! i’m disappointed in this, i feel like not many body acne washes are in the market and this was a bust! I don't hate this product but it is waaaaaaaaaayyy too gentle to be an effective peel or exfoliator. There are much better resurfacing masks out there within the same price range or cheaper. Unless you're willing to wait until you finish this bottle to finally see results, I recommend you not waste your money and get something with a higher percentage of glycolic acid. I just don’t feel like it’s doing anything for my acne. I want to love it I really do .. but I just don’t see it doing anything. This is so milky that it didn’t really soak into my skin I've been using this twice a day for 3 weeks, and haven't noticed any change in the blotchy redness I have around my cheekbones and up towards my temples. Just doesn't seem to be doing anything at all - a shame given the price, and especially after I received a free product replacement when my first order showed up with a broken cap. Don't think I'll be repurchasing. Was excited to try this in my acne-prone skin that has red marks leftover from old pimples. What am I missing? This did absolutely nothing. It smelled good, though.... Took me a bit to figure it out. Then when it actually warmed I felt it didn’t do what it said. Disappointed with the product It says to put water after applying it but it actually works better if you tap some water on your face and then apply this! Yes I feel the heat. But did nothing for my pores and blackheads. I was excited to try this and no good results didn’t see much. I used it for almost 3 weeks, every 2-3 days. I returned it. This product minimizes pores, to an extent. However, it doesn’t “extract” blackheads as most would have hoped when purchasing. The price is outrageous for the size of the bottle - and for that reason would never purchase again. A fair price would have been $22-27, not $39. Would highly recommend other products at the same price point. Doesn’t do what was advertised! I have been using this for a few weeks now and my eyes actually look worse! Glad it works for some of you but, stuff you get at drug stores are just as good This is not as good as I expected, I would not buy it again Not for oily girls! I have a combo skin prone to breakouts and guess what - this made me break out =( I also didn't like the consistency of the serum - it was too liquid to my liking. It smells nice just like their other products though. Based on all good reviews, may be I should try this product in a decade when I really will have to use age delay products instead of acne products. I love the eye lifting from the same line and use that for the whole face. This one does not work for me for lifting/wrinkle. 2 stars because has a great texture. I tried for 8 months. This product did not do much for my skin and it only lasted me a couple of months even when using a minimum amount each time. Much of the product was stuck to the bottom and I couldn’t get it out. I have used other Caudalie products and have been pleased. This one is not worth the money. I used this produce consistently for 2 weeks, no results. It made me break out much more than normally in places I haven’t on my face before. I want to say I liked the products in general but it stained my face pink even though I washed my face with a different cleanser. I have pink splotches all over my face. The moisturizer was nice and the face wash it didn’t dry out my skin. The Toner acne treatment I used to spot treat my problem areas are PINK. This mini set is very small. I expected the cleanser to be way bigger. I thought that it was working but after 2 weeks my skin began to get itchy and bumpy on my cheeks. I’m not sure if the acne cream treatment works. The spot treatment is ok. It sort of works but doesn’t clear a zit over night. The moisturizer is not enough for my skin. It left my skin feeling very dry. I needed to put some of my aveno cream on my face and it fixed it up but still bumpy! I am very disappointed in this product. I thought this could cure my acne... I’m going to try First aid beauty next.... I give it 2 stars because the cleanser wasn’t nearly as bad as the “yes to” face wash I tried out.\n",

I know this is not an every day use type of cream but I definitely did not see the results they hype up. The smell is nice but for the size I would not repurchase. I read many glowing reviews for this night cream, so I was really shocked when I tried it and it didn’t do anything for me. I didn’t care for the smell, and I just didn’t like how it felt on my face.

For how much this product costs, I was expecting more than what I got... which was nothing. This didn't work for me at all. I actually noticed my post-acne scars go away quicker when I wasn't using it. I don't feel that this did me any good, and I am very bummed I didn't return it when I had the chance - I kept holding out hope for it to work. The real name for Glycerin is Glycerol, identifying it for what it really is – an alcohol (-OL is the ending of alcohol group of chemical compounds). As any other alcohol, Glycerin is a degreaser – it absorbs lipids (oils), and removes them from your skin. Many people mistakenly think that because Glycerin has a sleek feel to it, it must be moisturizing. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. The sleekness of Glycerin is a result of the length of the molecules. They are much longer than regular alcohol (rubbing alcohol, for example) and therefore feel differently. To explain how drying Glycerin really is let’s just mention that it has 3 groups OH, the degreasing groups, while rubbing alcohol only has 1 group OH. So, Glycerin is much stronger than rubbing alcohol in its degreasing, drying action. Strong collagen in your skin is what prevents skin from sagging and developing wrinkles. Collagen is built from lipids. So, your skin needs lipids to remain looking young and firm. Glycerin robs your skin of its lipids, removing them when you remove the product off your skin. Instead of helping your skin, Glycerin deprives it of much needed lipids and we see the collagen levels drop, creating wrinkles and sagging.\n",

I'm disappointed as I love Kiehl's. I had read all of the positive reviews and decided to try this. I really like DDG's line of skin care. I didn't really notice any significant changes from using this like I had with the Sunday Riley Good Genes. Cost was a factor as to why I did not rebuy Good Genes. I'm thinking that in the future I will just need to save up and continue to buy GG. Maybe this worked well for others, but not so much for me. To be clear, this product works. It will give you results and it doesn’t murder your skin with redness during use as a person with combo skin. However, it is way too expensive for what it is and you can find the key ingredients in other less fluffy formulas. Also, if you have dry skin this formula will not do you favors. Will it work? Yes. Worth the price? No. After using this religiously I saw no noticeable results. For the price I was very disappointed.\n",

Seriously, if you have any dry skin THIS WILL NOT HELP YOU. But if you’re looking to slightly hydrate your skin this will do. Im kind of sad because the ratings on this was so high.. Also, I never leave reviews, but I felt like I needed to or something.. Way too much money for what it is. I’d say it’s an average primer. Not really a moisturizer. It’s good as a moisturizer alone, not to heavy, perfect to use at home with no make up on. When you put foundation on after the moisturizing step, it peeled off, resulting in peeling skin on the face. I loved this product - isn’t too heavy, didn’t break me out, the scent is delicate and not super intense. It really soaked into my skin nicely without looking greasy. Unfortunately, it broke up my setting powder without it sinking in fully. I’ve tried multiple setting powders - granted I had never had issues with either before using this moisturizer and was disappointed when it continued to become patchy and break up with different brands of setting powders.

I like this cream as it goes on smooth and is very moisturizing...however, the smell is HORRENDOUS. The cream smells like a sweaty jockstrap that has been left in a gym bag for a week. I wish I were exaggerating. The good thing is that the smell dissipates very quickly. So, if you can hold your breath while you first rub it in, then you're good to go.

It wasn’t bad the coverage was nice however it left my skin feeling and looking really oily which for my combo skin I don’t want. I wasn’t in love with it but I also didn’t hate it Oily combo skin here. Purchased this tho king it would give me extra hydration and softness. I’m half way through the bottle and really haven’t noticed a difference in my skin. I haven’t had any negative reactions to it either. Probably will not re-purchase. This makes my face feel so itchy that it keeps me up at night. Received the 7 day sample challenge that includes the day cream and have purchased this in full size but sadly had to return. The product works fine but due to the vinegar smell I won’t be purchasing again Really haven’t seen any difference. Feels nice, smell is pleasant enough, but no real difference. I would actually rate this product 3.5stars. It literally does what it says. Gives you a VERY dewy finish look..However, you can literally just buy the NYX dewy skin setting spray for less than $10 and have the exact same effect. Nice basic moisturizer. Does a good job at moisturizing the skin, but doesn't sink in as quickly as I like. I find that it often times pills under my primers and foundations. This is a very light moisturizer, if you have dry skin, this may not be for you. This would likely need to be reapplied or mixed with another product. Decent enough though. It’s okay. I won’t purchase again. Perfect for someone who likes light moisturizers. I have dry spots so it didn’t do much for me. Didn’t seem to do anything for my skin. I much prefer the squalene and tea tree oil but I have blemish prone skin. I’m torn between giving this 3 & 4 stars. At first I really loved the formula. It felt good and my skin felt hydrated. There is a greasy feeling at first but then it quickly turns into a smooth feeling as your skin starts to absorb it. But now I don’t think it’s worth the price. I’m towards the end of my bottle and still can’t really tell what this has done to improve my skin. Also, the dropper is too small and can’t reach the bottom of the bottle. The dropper is also cheap. Eventually the plastic squeezer came off and I had to start pouring the oil into my hand. This isn’t the packaging you expect for $70+.\n",

Мy husband refuses to kiss me when I put the cream on. And if you put a little more, it is not so well absorbed and traces remain as from an unsuccessful tonal cream Gave my skin a really nice dewy glow and was fairly moisturizing! It’s very light weight, but doesn’t cover much. I have acne and red spots which this does not help to cover them, I have to use extra concealer on top. It feel really great, however I wouldn’t recommend for someone with dry skin who lives in a dry/snowy climate in the winter. My skin after 2 hours starts to crack. I will keep the product to see how it performs during the spring/summer time. I miss the old formula!! This is too fragrant and almost feels diluted from the previous version... still works fine but I’d much rather prefer the prev face cream... this seems cheaper and less beneficial for my sensitive skin. I like the texture of the cream, is not too light and not too heavy, it makes my face feel soft, I use it as my night cream. I like the product except it has a light scent that I wish it did not have, I'm not sure if it smells like alcohol or perfume a bit but besides that is an okay moisturizer. I have sensitive skin to some products but surprisingly it didn't make me breakout or irritated my skin. I will finish the jar but most likely will not buy again.\n",
      "…read more Very loyal fan of Laneige Skincare, however I really dislike the new formulation of this moisturizer! It is way too fragranced! I feel like I’m putting perfume on my face. The. fragrance even lingers on my hands after application. The old formula had a slight fragrance, but so little that my skin was fine with it. The new formula irritates my skin, making it red and sensitive. I found this greasy, even when I only used a bit, so unless you wash your hair every day, this is not for you.. This is my main cream for the last year and a half. I swap in others at least once a week. Things I love, it’s super hydrating, absorbs pretty good, and one jar lasts a long time since you don’t need to use a lot of product. Things I don’t love, it can congest my skin a little, leaves skin looking/feeling greasy at first, and has some questionable ingredients. I really wish this gave better results firming my skin. I had switched to this from the lotus youth preserve when I felt signs of aging appear. I’m sticking with it for now, but still on the hunt for my dream cream. Using resurfacing night gels and weekly masks helps combat the congestion. I rounded down from 3.5 stars that I wanted to give because for the price I think it should be better at firming and have cleaner ingredients.\n",
      "…read more It may have a bit of tightening effect but I would not go so far as to call it corset like. I only use on my neck for fine 'tech neck' lines. smells like the other Black tea products with I don't love but is not off putting either. Perhaps I will see more results over time. Still, kind of expensive for no noticeable results. I received this Black Tea Corset Cream as a birthday gift. It is a nice, smooth, pleasant skin cream. It smells good, but not strong or perfumey. It works pretty well as a moisturizer. But the “Corset” part is nowhere to be found. A lot of the Fresh products I’ve tried are like this: Pleasing to use, but no quick results. And in my case, I use it almost exclusively on my neck. Sagging or loose skin and loss of elasticity are problems only on my throat and upper eyelids, so I use Caudalie serum and La Mer Cream on my face. For several weeks, I’ve faithfully used the “corset” cream on my neck and jawline. For the bold claim implied by its name, and the price, I really expected at least minor results by this time. But this corset ain’t pulled tight enough! I don’t even feel a minor, brief tightening or firming sensation when it goes on my skin. I feel nothing but a fairly light-textured moisturizer. The biggest disappointment is that the skin on my neck looks looser and less elastic than it did more than a month ago! I gave it three stars for the nice scent, smooth texture, and moisturizer. But the main attraction—that ‘face corset’ feeling and results are completely absent so far. I know there are much better skin firming neck and décolleté creams out there. But since this is a brand that, to me, makes milder and gentler products with slower results, I will be patient, hope for any firming of my throat, and finish the jar. With luck, Corset Cream is just a late bloomer that takes a long time to kick in. If it doesn’t start tightening skin, I’ll be heading over to Algenist, Perricone, or PTR. If this Black Tea Corset Cream doesn’t start showing any firming results, I will not purchase this (glad it was a gift) nor try the eye cream that goes along with it.\n",

Unfortunately for the first hour after I apply I notice my redness is aggravated and hyper sensitive. That being said...I did notice a difference in the plumpness of my skin and a lasting dewy effect throughout the day. I wish it was more suited for sensitive skin, but it does reduce fine lines and plump regardless of the immediate redness side effect.\n",

I don’t like this moisturizer at all! Sucks because I love organic skin care. I thought this would be one of the best moisturizers ever because of the ingredients and the price but I was dead wrong. I received this in a Herbivore sample package, “Glow and Hydrate” with the rose mist, glow mask and the Phoenix oil. I apply my oil after my moisturizer since I have sensitive, dry skin. I have tried mixing it with the moisturizer and applying it before my moisturizer but I just get better results applying the oil after the rest of my skin care regimen. No matter what, this moisturizer just piled and flaked off of my face! I hate it when a moisturizer does that because I feel an intense need to wash it off, IMMEDIATELY! It also smells like whiskey? Very odd. I wanted to love it but I don’t like it at all. I am glad that I tried this sample before committing to the full size. I loved the rest of the items I received, though. I love Herbivores oils. I use them in place of moisturizer at night time. I have currently been using the Dr Jart spf cicapair moisturizer during the day. For a better version of this, I would suggest the Sweet Chef Moisture Boost! That is the best moisturizer that I have ever tried!!! Sweet Chef is owned by glow recipe and is sold at Target and is a clean skin care line!!! :) Loooove their kale hydrating mask!! The only downfall with the moisture boost is that it doesn’t contain any sunscreen.\n",

May be nice on the skin... but I can get over the smell.. like strong sunscreen.. Really nice to be able to try this very very expensive product without having to go all in with the $100 tub. This is a nice thick cream, but very scented and a little irritating. In the end I don't think I will be investing in the full size It's a heavy moisturizer, best for winter. Nothing particularly earth shattering about it, even though I am a huge Charlotte fan! Lovely, slight rosy smelling product with a nice creamy feel, not greasy, and with a satiny finish. However, not recommended for large pores/oily skin. I have large pores, and the satin sheen from the cream accentuated every pore into massive craters. Really makes a girl feel lousy. On the bright side, I applied the cream to my dry hands, and voila! The moisturizer does a fine job of hydrating the back of my hands, and the nice sheen adds a brilliant touch, especially around the cuticles, making my entire hands look hydrated and glowy. Great product, but not for my porous face.\n",

But, I refuse to fork over my hard-earned dollars for something that yields mediocre to subpar results for me.

I didn’t find this product that moisturizing unfortunately. the smell and texture are very nice and it feels great upon first application, but after a while it leaves my skin wanting more... much prefer my Caudalie moisturizer. Peimer does add a burst of hydration as advertised. I wish it didn't smell like when I sharpen my No 2 pencil in school.. Went to sephora to get a heavy duty moisturizer for my dry flaky skin. A nice salesman talked me into this one and I’d say it’s just ok. Won’t buy again because of the price and the lackluster results. I’m really surprised and conflicted with this product. I love everything Murad usually. This product is a beautiful consistency, makes my skin nice, and controls my oil all day......but that FRAGRANCE!!!!! it’s soooooo strong like straight perfume. I normally dislike fragrance in products as it is because it’s a skin irritant and can cause breakouts or bumps.... but Murad is usually fine because the fragrance is very faint. Not this though!!! it’s insanely strong and smells like an old lady’s perfume and the fragrance does not dissipate when you apply. It stays all day and it gives me a massive headache :(\n",

I keep my products stored in a temperature controlled environment and am nothing if not gentle with every product I have invested my hard earned money in. So I thought that was pretty pathetic for such a high end company and high price tag product. I had to put my oil in my own bottle to continue to using. All in all, the oil itself is indeed very nice, i have yet to notice any actual difference in my skin compared to using an oil half the price. So i will not be re-purchasing this particular product again,\n",
      "…read more I love the vinoperfect serum, but this one broke me out. Returned for the Herbivore emerald oil and love it. In general, I thought this face cream was ok, but I wouldn't purchase it again. I was looking for a moisturizing cream with SPF to wear under my foundation, and this works ok, but it's definitely pretty oily. It did protect my skin from sun damage, which I appreciated. I live in Seattle so I really only needed this in the summer. I think because it's kind of thick and leaves my face feeling greasy, it wasn't the best to wear under foundation. So if you don't really wear makeup, this might be ok, but it'll make your face kind of shiny.\n",

Plus as the day progressed, it migrated into my eyes and caused my eyes to water. I love several other products from the First Aid Beauty brand, but this one just isn't seeming to do it for me. The price is great, but my biggest complains have to do with 1. the smell and 2. the texture. It smells like bananas to me. I like to eat bananas and sometimes the smell is nice, but this smell just really bothers me. Especially because I continue to smell it on my face. I'm also not crazy about the texture. It's extremely oily. I have dry/combination skin and have to use lots of powder over this moisturizer to decrease shine.\n",

Maybe it would be good for the summer but it doesn’t cut it for winter! Not bad but it's not a product I would buy again. It's a bit stick and does not soak into my skin and leave it feeling hydrated, rather it seems to sit on top of my skin. Not really a fan of the way it dispenses either, not sure I'm going to know when the container is close to empty. Feels nice on the skin and relaxing. Love that I can fall asleep with it on and not having to wake up to wash my face. But I think it's meant for younger skin. I havent finished the bottle, but I dont think I will be buying again after I finish. If you have younger skin, I would recommend it, but not for 50 . Dudnt see much difference. Really wanted this to hit it out of the park for me but I haven’t noticed a difference in terms of anti-aging or plumping. My skin is noticeably softer but that’s not what my main desire was when I purchased this. Giving it one more try tonight and if I still am underwhelmed, it’s going back. I am 38 with fair combination skin. This moisturizer is a little bit on the oilier side. I think it's great for winter season, but I wouldn't use it any other season. There are definitely better moisturizers. I love the amount of product that this comes in. I don’t feel like it does anything special but it is nice when you use other products that have active ingredients. Doesn’t my my combo skin super oily. I definitely think this would be a great moisturizer for winter time. Definitely feels nice and doesn’t have really any smell. It is truly ultra! My face is shiny every day that I use this moisturizer. I’ve really scaled back on the amount that I apply. I guess I keep using it bc I don’t want to waste money but this formula is not for me, especially not during the summer when I truly have combination skin. Kind of greasy and made me breakout every time I used it. I like this brand but not this product. I bought a full size bottle of this after I received a free sample and liked it because it was moisturizing. It goes on greasy though. I then found a cheaper alternative at a natural grocery store so I think this is overpriced for what you can buy at the natural food grocery store. It worked fine and didn't cause me to break out but I've since moved on to other products. I would not buy this again because there are more affordable aragan oils available. The dropper applicator was a pain, it would have been better in a spray bottle.\n",

I don’t honestly think it does anything in the way of preventing blemishes or reducing current blemishes. It does last a long time. I’ve had it for 5 or so months. Lathers well. Price is good. All in all it’s ok but I certainly do not think it is the miracle products others have reviewed. Not the best. This does work but not near as good as others I have tried. I will use it up but not repurchase I liked the smell and the feel of this on my face. However, it is very difficult to squeeze out of the tube. Was it old? I loved this scrub when I first purchased a year ago, but I just made a repurchase and I was a bit saddened. The older formula had a nice exfoliating scrub, but this new formula has changed. I hate when companies put the plastic exfoliating balls in products! Although the sandy texture is slightly still there, the micro-beads are annoying me. I took two stars because I hate the beads. This wasn't the worst wash ever but did not impress me at all. So many better options. Returned Con: my eye hurts; not gentle as labeled, my skin feels dry after using; Pro: a little goes a ling way; lather well; This is just an eh cleanser for me. It smells good, sweet but clean and that's probably the biggest pro for me. On its own, it cleanses just fine but after rinsing my dry skin feels tight and overly cleansed. I like it best when used after a cleansing balm because the pair together don't leave my skin feeling tight. Definitely wouldn't go out of my way to use it again. Not a huge fan of this. I don't find it does much to my skin and the texture is quite thick for a cleanser. This product is a green cream that foams up nicely and it feels really nice and silky on the skin. However, I have oily skin sensitive skin and this product made my face feel tight. It was a strange feeling because it didn't look like it stripped my face as it left a residue on my face that made my face look shiny. But my face still felt tight and uncomfortable. I bought the small $25 tube and ended up returning it after 2 uses. I wanted to try a different cleanser and expected more from this product because I heard it was supposed to be a \"hydrating\" cleanser but no cleanser has worked for me like Cetaphil's Gentle Cleanser.\n",

I couldn’t get over how small the tube was, and the cleanser itself is not a miracle or holy grail cleanser, therefore I couldn’t see myself paying $95 for the larger/full size. The cleanser however, did cleanse my skin good without leaving it tight, stripped or dry. It actually left my skin smooth and feeling hydrated. The scent didn’t smell luxurious or anything but it wasn’t bad. It’s like a fresh, light, green Irish spring soap kind of smell, and I expected more from La Mer as far as that.

My acne has gotten sooo bad in the course of a week of using this product. It does a good job at cleaning makeup but is super drying. Not good if you have acne prone skin I’ve been using this cleanser from the SK-II travel-size set for the past week, and it is a good basic cleanser. I’ve never been able to get it to foam like the model does in the demonstration video, but it does lather enough to serve its purpose and cleanse the skin. The scent is a very light soapy smell, which is nice. And once the cleanser is washed away, skin feels clean and not over dried. However, this cleanser is not very well suited for my breakout-prone skin because I need something either with more texture to scrub the skin, or stronger acne-targeting ingredients to reduce my breakouts. I’ve reduced a star on this rating because it doesn’t do a good job of addressing my breakouts, and reduced another star because of the high price for such a basic cleanser. I’m a huge fan of SK-II products, but don’t think the price is quite justified on this particular one. This cleanser would be well-suited for someone primarily focused on maintaining clean skin, without any major skin concerns.

Dont see a difference using this cleanser. Does not clean very well. This is a tough one.

I told her that I need something oil free cause I have lash extensions and she recommended these. They don’t do really good job removing make up (especially for the price offered), have to use additional product to make it work well These are good, they do the job but they are really overpriced for what they are. They're just wipes-not worth it. Not as good as the original “Take the Day Off” balm. Pretty good as a backup, when washing your face with the original product is not possible. The wipes are fine, the price is fair, but the dispenser is too large for the standard boxes and doesn't close properly. Wipes dry out without a good seal. I've been a long time user of the clinique clarifying lotions but gave this a try on my quest to find a alcohol-free toner. It's alright. It does feel very calming and soothing on the skin, but thats about it. It is heavily fragranced so if you are sensitive to fragrance and dyes, I would stay away from this. It was ok. Definitely not one of the best toners i’ve tried. The smell is way to strong and in my opinion it doesn’t do anything for the skin except moisturize it. I was pretty surprised to find that in an \"alcohol free\" toner, two of the top ingredients are types of alcohol. The scent is nice, very herbal, but I didn't find it hydrating at all. I have very sensitive skin and although it didn't irritate it, it did leave me with that tight, dry feeling as though the alcohol pulled all the moisture out of my skin. I'm disappointed with the product because I was hoping for a hydrating toner. This leaves my skin squeaky clean, and not in a good way. It’s hard to rinse it all off because my skin is so stripped. And its not even that good at removing makeup. I like more luxurious products that feel like they’re improving my skin as I use them. This isn’t one of those products. Gets the job done. However, even if a little bit gets into my eyes it hurts a lot. Won’t be using after finishing this tube. This cleanser is alright. Nothing special. It cleans my face just fine but is a bit drying. Better for oily skin. Also, be careful, it stings my eyes really bad. 3 stars (meaning good but wouldn't buy again.) Three is as high as I can go. The bottle says it’s cooling and that’s 100% true. However, it also “burned” my sensitive skin after three uses so I’m going to take it back and keep researching! I’ve been using this toner for 5 days and twice a day. My t-zone area is very oily and I have tiny blackheads in that area as well. This toner helped to reduce the appearance of the blackheads on my nose, but it makes my skin slightly dry. I will try to to use more moisturizer and see where that goes! I had high expectations for this toner since I really like Murad, but i have not seen any mayor improvements on my acne, on the contrary I have experienced more oiliness and breakouts, don't really want to attribute it to this toner but that what I've noticed.

However, it also “burned” my sensitive skin after three uses so I’m going to take it back and keep researching! I’ve been using this toner for 5 days and twice a day. My t-zone area is very oily and I have tiny blackheads in that area as well. This toner helped to reduce the appearance of the blackheads on my nose, but it makes my skin slightly dry. I will try to to use more moisturizer and see where that goes!

It has a strong smell and I can feel the alcohol on my face. Will not purchase again. This is the fanciest thing I own. It’s lovely, and I repurchased it because I’m a sucker, but it’s basically extremely expensive face spritz. It’s refreshing and smells like heaven but the ingredients list is nothing to really write home about and it makes your face a tiny bit sticky! If you could buy jasmine flower water easily this would be a no brainer to make at home. If you’re not coming into money I would skip it! Beautiful packaging and it smells great, it helps with oil control but makes my face feel really dry after putting it on. Like I feel like I need to rush to get a moisturizer on because it's so uncomfortably dry, and makes my face itchy. I wanted to love it but my face says no :( I've tried many things from the Herbivore line so far and this is my least favorite so far. I am not really sensitive to smells but boy this stuff smells truly awful. I really don't understand the reviews saying that it smells \"good\" and that makes me wonder if some batches of the product are turning bad. I have to cover up the scent by putting on some Mario Badescu rose toner right after. As far as balancing/toning benefits, I haven't noticed anything worth writing home about. The 3 stars are for the clean ingredients and packaging.\n",
      "…read more I like her fine, but kind of the way that you like a coworker you *have* to put up with because you bought them before you did research (? what am I saying). Like, they do a good job at work but they talk about their relationship too much and it just kinda bothers you. This lady has squalene, which I enjoy very much, but it also has so many essential oils and some other things that I don't enjoy very much. It doesn't emulsify up very well, either. I mean, it does emulsify with some water added, but it's just not very satisfying. My skin feels nice when I wash it off, but I just wish the ingredients list was more simple. Also, like, I thought this brand was supposed to be super natural and wholesome, but after doing some research, it's not really?? I'm currently trying to use more \"clean\" type products, so would not repurchase.\n",
      "…read more I want to love this. It works SO well, it smells nice, my makeup comes off with ease... but it made my skin breakout! I stopped using it, let my skin clear up, and tried again and I broke out again. My work around is using it just on my eye makeup and not to remove the makeup on the rest of my face and that seemed to help. It just clogged up my pores on my chin, unfortunately. Be aware if you are acne prone. i thought i would like this a lot more than i did because i love Kiehl's but it didn't take my makeup off really at all, and i wasn't even wearing anything waterproof. the amount of product i think i would have to use every night just isn't worth the price tbh. i also have sensitive skin and it didn't fully break me out, but it made my complexion more red than normal. I really like these wipes, after you've wiped a couple of times around your eyes it hurts. But they work well. More gentle than other wipes but still nothing so special about this Does not irritate my face but it doesn’t clear my acne. O.K.... I expect more for this price point and brand (I love some of the other products). I first used this toner and a bottle down later, was not so sure about using toners. It did not do too much for my oily skin save make it a little more cleaner after face washing. I switched to another that was almost half the price (Murad) with witch hazel and that really worked to clear and shrink my pores. I don’t think this is a bad product, but not for my oily skin.\n",
      "…read more The product is way to strong for my skin. My skin broke out from using it in just two weeks. It actually burns. I would recommend it for someone with sensitive skin. I returned it Just okay, but for me not worth repurchasing at this price. Im over 3/4 of the way finished with the bottle and haven’t seen any improvement in my blackheads or dullness. It does work as a nice general toner, but no better than a average drug store version. It was strong and effective but slightly harsh. Ive been using this entire line for 4 months ,its ok but mot worth the money. I have been using this product for a couple of years now and was bummed when the formula, bottle, and size were changed but decided to give it a try. I am on my second and final bottle of the changed formula. It just didn't live up to its predecessor and price remained the same. I can no longer recommend this product. This was my cleanser for about a year. It worked well in the first run, but as I used it, I noticed how drying this was to my oily skin. It dried my skin out forcing me to use a moisturizer immediately. I thought this would help my acne but there was no effect. I would suggest a more soothing cleanser that is not as abrasive or drying. I love PTR but this cleanser seems to be quite simplistic and I don't see any improvements in my skin since I started using it three months ago. I do like that the cleanser doesn't dry out my skin as my moisture barrier is being repaired. Overall, it is not worth the price imo I like that these blotting papers do not leave any powdery residue on my face, and they are effective in blotting shine. However, the perfume-like scent is so strong that I could smell the unsealed but closed pack, every time that I walked by my vanity table. My eyes are sensitive to fragrance, and these actually made my eyes water. It works ok, not as good as other blotting papers i have used. The smell is disgusting. Normal facial foaming cleanser tho. This is a great product for the value. I find that it cleans the skins well (I do use a balm before to remove makeup), my skin has looked less red. The only thing that would keep me from repurchasing is the smell, it has a very strong scent which I don't find pleasant. I have combo skin. I found that the Clarins cleanser was too drying compared to the drugstore brand I was using. I do have some dry patches around my nose and forehead, but the rest of skin is oily. It did a great job with removing the excess oil, but my skin would feel tight and stripped of ALL my oil that I'd have to overcompensate with my moisturizer. It smells and feels exactly like using a bar of soap on your face. I'm going to be switching back to my drugstore brand because I feel like my skin is going to breakout soon :( However, I gave this product 3 stars because I am in the midst of winter now (my skin becomes drier), so I'm going to revisit this product in the summer and see if it feels any better.\n",
      "…read more Good product. It feels like it cleans well. Personally I like the texture, how it foams up and the scent. It does leave your face a bit dry after washing. So you have to follow up with your toner and moisturizer. The only con is the tube opening. When you squeeze the tube, you have to squeeze extra because of the tube design. You really only need a pea size to clean your face. I find this is not the best eye makeup remover for me because I use a lot of waterproof mascaras. I can see it being nice and non-greasy for normal mascaras. Unfortunately, I struggle every night to take off even half of my mascara with this one. Especially with comparison to the Lancome eye makeup remover, this is much less effective for me. I bought this to replace Sephora non-greasy eye makeup remover I can not longer get (discontinued). It works well, but I've the added step of rinsing or I'd give it 4 or 5 starts. I haven’t tried it yet but hope I like it since I am used to the one in the purple bottle. Not sure why I couldn’t find the product I always use but then every time I go to try on or purchase a product I use and love it is never in stock. Yes I can order online but sometimes I would like to try it first. This has happened the last 3 times I have gone to a store. Very disappointed!! Meh- I am an avid user of the gel to foam cleansers, and this one is just not my fave or worth the money. The scent smells like black licorice which can be an issue for some people, but I find the larger problem when looking back at some of my favorite foam cleansers (Lancome Creme Radiance, or my current obsession Bliss Triple Oxygen mask). I use the product in the shower and find that there is little to no \"foam\" regardless of the amount of time trying to work it into a lather.\n",
      "…read more This product was nice. But I found that the charcoal (or charcoal products in general) give my skin texture. This product felt very nice while on my skin, but it didn’t help me with smoothing. This just isn’t the one for me! Solid cleanser! Gentle and doesn't strip the moisture on your skin at all. A little goes a long way which is nice. Doesn't do much for makeup removal though, so as i was using the system - i would take my makeup off first, then polish, then cleanse (then nourish). You should probably be using a separate makeup remover anyway, but in a pinch i like a double duty cleanser. I like it but do not love it. Doesn’t feel like it rinses off. The exfoliating scrub feels cleaner when rinsed. It works well if the consistency is your thing. I used this in the summer, when my skin had peeled from a sunburn. It exfoliates nicely, but does leave you dry. I told the salesperson I liked the Soy Face Cleanser but was open to trying something different for the winter. My skin definitely feels soft after cleansing with the Soy Milk but I am not so sure of how clean it is. I am not in love with it and wouldn’t use it ever in the summer. Cetaphill makes a better version of a gentle cleanser. Felt nice and gentle while using, but left my skin tight, dry and flaky. Not a good cleanser if you use a prescription retinoid. Associate told me this would do the trick as my makeup remover (was between this and the Tatcha oil, which is $$$). Ended up returning because it didn't remove the waterproof eyeliner - too much work. Otherwise, nice and refreshing. I love other Caudalie products but not this one. I guess this does an okay job removing makeup, but it is way too irritating, especially for eyes. I didn’t even use it to remove my eye makeup and it still irritated my eyes! It must be the fragrance. When are skincare companies going to understand we don’t need the fragrance? Going to have to return. This is my first time using an oil cleanser and it’s just ok. My main issue is that the consistency is like water and basically goes right thru my fingers. I have to use many squirts just to get enough to feel like I’m cleaning my face. I’d prefer something that is a little thicker consistency and not so watery. I bought this product because I thought it had witch hazel in it and I wanted the witch hazel for it’s soothing properties. When I got home I looked at the list of ingredients. There is no witch hazel in this product, although the name of the product claims that it contains it. I even looked up the scientific/genus name for witch hazel (Hamamelis) to see if it was listed in the ingredients. It is not. I specifically bought this product for the witch hazel. I will be returning it tomorrow.\n",
      "…read more I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. I've been using it for a few months, but have to noticed any drastic changes in my skin. It does help a little with oil control and does clean my skin on application. I don't feel like it does much to help my pores or purify my skin though. I will say that I am happy that it doesn't try out my skin like some oil control toners. Nice toner, but didn’t help with my acne. Maybe even made it worse? Very gentle and kind to skin though This isn’t for me I guess. I LOVE PTR products absolutely some of the best in the market but for me this face wash hasn’t done anything I expected. I have adult hormonal acne and I thought this product would help prevent or calm down some of it but it hasn’t. The quantity for the price is amazing and the cleanliness of this product is amazing.

      "…read more This is a great basic cleanser. I use topical tretinoin and clindamycin and I had to irritation or side effects! Love the creamy texture and smell. Like soft lemon. But I felt it didn’t take makeup off and left a weird film on my skin Very gentle cleanser. I wanted to try different cleansers to see what would work best with my skin. I use full coverage makeup with setting spray afterwards. Cleanser doesn’t seem to remove all the foundation the first time, usually have to use it twice in order to ensure my makeup is all off. This cleanser cleans well and smells great, but it unfortunately leaves my skin feeling very dry. For that reason, I would not repurchase it, but I can see others enjoying this product. Another plus for me is that it did not cause my sensitive skin to break out as other products often do-- I just wish it wasn't so drying. This was just OK. Did not break me out and my face was clean after use but it left my face feeling 'tight' and stripped of moisture. Not worth the price to me. I was not super impressed with this. It just was kind of basic in every way. Decent as a makeup remover, but the exfoliation left a lot to be desired. And it left a bit of a weird residue. Overall, just ok. Don’t love it, don’t hate it. This remover was actually very irritating to my eyes. But, I've found that it does a great job at taking off lip stains/lipstick without irritating my lips, so not so bad? This soap makes my skin so smooth it’s insane! I bought it to help with my blackheads though, and it did absolutely nothing to clear them or any other blemishes up. I also wish that the smell would stay on my skin longer. It does last a while too! I’ve heard a lot about charcoal and how it can help with acne. I thought I’d give it a try for $12. Let me start by saying I’ve acne for over 10 years, have tried everything (including accutane x 2) and my acne came back. Personally, this soap didn’t seem to help with my acne. I also don’t think it made it worse. The soap wasn’t particularly drying but it might be for those with dry or extra dry skin. Received a deluxe size of this as part of the holiday gift set. It worked great at exfoliating my skin but not drying it out. However, after less than 2 weeks of use, it precipitated little white pellet balls. Not sure what happened. I still have about 2/3 of the bottle left but can't use it. Not sure if the full jar would have this issue. This cleanser will last a long time- you only need a small bit of it to get a good lather. However, it left my skin feeling tight and dry. The performance of the cleanser is fine. Not drying. Works as a perfect second cleanse. But the scent. It’s atrocious. Like rancid roses. It’s enough that I can’t bring myself to keep using it. It makes your skin smell like roses and leaves it refreshed, and the foam formula makes it very gentle on the skin. I am still waiting for results on my skin because i just started using it. Used to use caudalie foam cleanser and wanna try something new. This fresh one works fine but it smells terrible, kinda fishy on my face... I tried not to breathe when I was using it This product does stink, but not like sulfur. It just straight up stinks. However, the smell doesn’t last long. It does mattify the skin, but to do so it leaves a little powder residue on the skin which I’m not a fan of. But if you can get past the powder and the residue it’s great. I'm happy with the results of this product, but my GOD does it stink. Like someone else mentioned, it's reminiscent of a dirty dish rag or something. I almost gagged the first time. I want to love it and re-order but I probably won't because of the smell. Even though I'm happy with the results it produces, the smell is just too brutal to endure. smells super bad... but it does mattify the skin. would not buy based on the scent though.. its strong and super noticeable. This product is something that should definitely be sampled first. The smell is terrible and the product does seem to have only minimal benefits. I noticed my skin looked more matte after cleansing and applying this toner but it was negated by some of the products I used afterwards, such as my moisturizer. I haven’t noticed any breakouts using this product but I don’t think they’ve gotten better either. But to each their own.\n",
      "…read more I used this for a week and it made my skin feel soft however the smell is terrible. It smells so bad boyfriend asked me if I vomited. I thought I could get use to the smell but I couldn’t. Had to return it. Started using this over a month ago and I still have a lot of blemishes on my face. It does help on my breakouts when I do have them. I never experienced the old formula so I can’t relate. I’ll keep using it till it’s finished. If I don’t see any other changes then I will not be using this again This smells alright, but is so thick it clogged my pores. I bought it to leave on overnight since my skin is so dry, but it was just greasy and never totally absorbed in. I used a little and really rubbed it in but that didn't help much. It isn’t easy for me to rate this 3 stars because this was my most anticipated purchase last year. I don’t hate it — but I only love it because it’s Charlotte Tilbury. I have used this as secondary wash after my initial face cleansing (doesn’t remove makeup well enough on own) These do the job but honestly I don’t understand the hoopla around these. There is nothing special or luxurious about these. They remind me of fine handkerchiefs from days past. A bit over rated and expensive (imho) for these. I like the smell and the appearance of the bottle. It feels nice on my skin and it makes me feel fresh in the morning. The big down side to this is that it hasn't really done anything for my skin - good or bad. Why only 3*, the scent is a bit strong for me. It works well on my sensitive skin. I have normal to dry skin, just not sure it did anything for me. Finished the bottle, not overwhelmed. Can’t say it performed any better than the toner I got at Target. Wasn’t bad but wasn’t amazing either. I was looking for a moisturizing toner to use on nights I incorporated retinol into my routine so I got this one. It sounded amazing on paper but so far every time I’ve used it my face is left stinging immediately after. If you do not find witch hazel bothersome to your skin, you will probably like this. Nope. Broke me out. Usually have great experiences with algenist, not this time. 3 stars because Ingredients look really good so I’m really surprised my skin reacted that way, possible reaction to a certain ingredient? This is a fine toner, and a really good price considering how much you get. However, it didn't really do much for my skin. My skin didn't feel any more hydrated than when I use a rosewater mist (maybe even less so) and I think it even sensitized it a bit, maybe because of the witch hazel or the added fragrance? I used most of it but won't repurchase. As an exfoliant, it does the job well without stripping the skin. This exfoliant does not make my skin feel tight after cleansing with it as it has a creamy consistency. Will not be repurchasing due to the smell - it’s as if I were walking into a hospital. I often mix it with my cleanser in the shower so that I can mask the smell. Not sure what this is supposed to do. If it’s exfoliation to brighten I would say a hard pass. There are others that do better. Meh at best for this one. I think this product does an adequate job. I bought it to try after using the ole Hendrickson exfoliator. I loved the OH one but wanted to try something new. This one has a funky smell I’m not wild about and there is much less texture than the OH pore Balance product This stuff does its job and doesn’t irritate my skin. I have super oily skin with patches of eczema around my nose. Some people seem to dislike the smell but I never mind the smell of a product as long as it’s does it’s purpose. I’m going to try another exfoliater after this but I did use the whole bottle. It just was g anything special. This scrub is very abrasive. I found it similar to the Fresh Umbrian Clay scrub. No suds and very scratchy. It felt a bit like oil with sand in it, it felt very awkward to use. Although it is described as safe for sensitive skin, it was too abrasive for me. If you are sensitive like me, but still want a good scrub off, try the Caudalie Deep Cleansing Exfoliator instead. This removed all my mascara... easily.... but it really burned my eyes. Even diluted with a wet cotton pad it still bothered me. So I returned it. It's a bit disappointing. I still have to rub pretty hard to get the mascara off and it irritates the skin around my eyes. I did not like this toner. Besides the fact that it didn't have a great smell, it did absolutely nothing positive for my face. I wouldn't purchase this again. This is a very average toner. I have dry and sensitive skin and was expecting more from this product. It didn't irritate my skin at all (which is surprising given the witch hazel), but it didn't improve it in any way either. There are better toners out there. Decent for on-the-go toning. Its more of a gimmick but it is very soothing on the skin. It does calm inflammation slightly. This toner smells and feels nice but I honestly don’t know if it does anything. It doesn’t strip or dry your face but I don’t think I will repurchase. This product did not cause acne and was not super drying for me. However, I didn't notice a real difference in the redness / texture of my skin. Just a toner, doesn’t do anything at all. Doesn’t make the skin feel clean or refreshed, doesn’t tighten or brighten, doesn’t balance out the oils on the fave throughout the day... Kind of a useless product I love how this smells and feels, but I noticed my skin breaks out when I use it every day. Upon closer inspection, I see the alcohol content is high and it's not good for the skin. I'll be hunting for something else. Such a pity as it does feel great, but it dries the skin too much and then causes pimples. The cleanser works but I will not buy again because of the wasteful packaging. I understand you only need a small amount but maybe just provide a small measuring spoon in a jar. Also, not a fan of the scent. It’s a little off-putting and lingers after you dry your face. I really loved this product at first, it removes redness perfectly and hydrates well too, I used first bottle in one month and got another one. Second bottle caused multiple breakouts in a half of a month of using. Probably it happened because of coconut oil in it, so be aware Its not a bad cleanser, but definitely not worth the price. I like their soft lotion very much, but didnt like their cleanser and toner. Average product. I'm really surprised that this has such glowing reviews. I ordered it based on the reviews I have combination skin Asian skin, aged 33, acne prone and sun damage. Used nickel size amount of cleanser on dry face to remove makeup, it melts easily and spreads smoothly but does not completely remove eye mascara/makeup. I use this as a first step , and then follow with a mild foam cleanser. My skin is left with a layer after this, keeping it hydrated (?), and after my second cleanse it doesn’t feel dry. As a cleansing balm, you might be able to find similar products at lower price point. Haven’t been able to see anti-aging effects and might not be able to. This is a luxury cleansing balm... splurge if you have the money but I think you can find similar products elsewhere.\n",

Been using this product for over two weeks with no noticeable difference in my fine lines. I did give it three stars because my skin looks healthier since using it. Sorry. This makes my oily skin dry so bad. This is not for sensitive skin. I have to stopped using it. I retuned the product. I use this and the AHA Resurfacing Liquid once a week each. My skin does still get dry and perky and flaky, but it’s minimized if you use lots of moisturizer and SPF during the day. I’ll also use GlamGlow’s Thirsty Mud twice a week the night after I use these products so that some intensive moisture is restored. I am noticing that a lot of my acne has gone down, which is nice, and the fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth are plumping up quite nicely. I would have ranked it five stars if it wasn’t so drying, and if it wasn’t so YELLOW. It completely stains my face. Once I put my moisturizer on it isn’t so bad, but there’s still a stark ring of yellow on the perimeter of my face and in my hairline. Really annoying, but since I only use it once a week it’s not the biggest deal.\n",
      "…read more I’m torn, I actually like this serum, goes on smooth and absorbs very quickly ready for a moisturizer. But... the smell! It’s horrific. It’s like chocolate had a really bad day and wasn’t wearing deodorant. I loved SK-II’s original serum. It made my extra large pores just the tiniest bit smaller. This new serum is not as effective. It doesn’t do much for my pores. It’s also heavier. What this serum does do a better job at is calming the redness in my skin and keeping it hydrated. I generally use this at night b/c when I use it during the day it leaves my oily t-zone a little bit more shiny. Disappointed when order arrived, the jar was only half full, so not much cream for the money paid. As for results - I don’t see any significant change to my skin, but I only use it at night so maybe this is the reason. I like Perricone treatments/ serums, especially but I’m not sure if this cream is worth the money it costs. While this moisturizer is quite luxe, I found that it wasn't great to wear during the day under makeup as it balled up. It was also wasn't as moisturizing as I'd hoped - I had some flakiness through the day. I totally love the cold plasma by Dr. Perricone but this for me is nothing special. I get better moisture from other less expensive brands. It is again for me not worth the price. You'll be surprised how small this container is when you receive it. The product worked, but by no means did it perform any miracles. I feel I can find just as good of a product for a fraction of this price. I will continue the search for a perfect moisturizer. I liked this moisturizer but I didn't love it. It did keep my skin hydrated and less oily but that's about it. I didn't see any difference in my fine lines or dullness in my skin. It's just not worth the prize. I can get a drugstore night cream that would do pretty much the same thing. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for review purposes. I really like how light this moisturizer is and how it makes my skin feel smooth. I am not a fan of the smell however. Just a little dab goes a long way. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. It’s a good product... just started using it.. no visible changes but will keep using it I am 63 years old and found this to be too harsh on my skin. Used 3 x first week, then cute down to only once a week and still to much peeling. Two advices. 1. AVOID USING THIS PRODUCT ARIUND YOUR EYE AREA. 2.USE VERY LITTLE AMOUNT with lots and lots of moisturizer on top. I messed up and forgot to not to put it around my eye area and they’re all burnt. On the third night I got too excited and used a little more than my skin can tolerate and now my entire face is burnt. If used wisely, little by little mixed with some heavy duty moisturizer, this product does make a difference. However if you do not follow the instruction, you’ll end up with a burnt skin.\n",

I use this for night time only, followed by the Youth-Renewing Power Night Cream. It does leave my face feel soft afterwards, but that's about it. Nothing special.. The product itself is very nice, goes on and absorbs well. My skin looks great. Unfortunately the scent is overwhelming. If not for the smell I would have happily given 4-5 stars I don't notice a huge difference between this and cheaper retinol products. It seems to work on my breakouts but does little to nothing on scarring. I don't think it is worth the price. I wasn't super impressed by this product. The pads don't really smell like anything and don't give my skin a good burn or tingle so I can't tell if the salicylic acid is working. Will probably not re-purchase. I have combination skin Asian skin, aged 33, acne prone and sun damage. This felt nice on my skin, gives a little tingle. I definitely purged when I started using this in the first couple weeks but it has since minimized and I haven’t had more or less breakouts. Not sure it made a huge difference in my skin. Haven’t compared it to a true retinol. It smells nice, like peach/apricot. On my face, it dries out my skin and has caused a lot of acne. On my body scars I'm waiting to see if it makes even a little improvement- but I've been using it consistently for two weeks and I'm feeling disappointed. It’s ok. Not my favorite. Probably great for someone just starting out with retinoids though! Feels good. Dries quickly. Smells good. Helped with one hyperpigmentation/post acne scar when i first use it but after that its barely doing anything. Like it just made a good impression but that good impression did not last. I use it morning and night and only have 1/4 left of the bottle. Will not buy again. Ehhhhh. I wanted to like this product but I wasn’t blown away by the results because I didn’t notice any. It’s an expensive product but I think another brand does a better job. I received this gift complimentary in exchange for my honest review. While I liked the product overall... I found that it dried my skin out if I used it daily. I would need to alternate it to every other day to avoid this. The product lasts a long time even though it's in small packaging. I received the item FREE from Influenster to review. I've been using it since the first week of August and to be honest I haven't noticed any changes, good or bad, my skin does not look better or worse because of this serum, so no I wouldn't buy it again, not worth it. I bought this years ago but haven't been reaching for it very often. This product is packed with silicone, it makes sense because it focuses on \"pore minimizing\" (although temporary), but it does not do much of anything else, which is why I don't find it ideal as a serum. HOWEVER, I recently started using it again by mixing it with moisturizers or sunscreens and then I got a great primer! The end product effectively fills my pores while providing other benefits from products that I already know would work. But still, 3 stars because 1) doesn't work for me as a serum; 2)a bit pricey as a primer\n",
      "…read more It would probably be fantastic for mature skin, this one was just a tad heavy for me I’m very ambivalent about this product . I bought the full size and have been using it for 5-6 months on a daily basis. I used it as a moisturizer. However I found it just sat on top of my skin and never absorbed! It left my face very greasy to touch even after 15-20 mins. It also irritated my skin somewhat every time I applied it(maybe the anti-aging product is supposed to cause tingling?). I don’t notice much difference in my skin tone after each use. However my skin does appear to be firmer in the morning , not sure if it has to do with this particular product...\n",

I genuinely saw no difference. It felt super watery going on and like I always got too much product out. I saw no brightness to my skin with this. I did not enjoy this product and found myself missing the previous vitamin C serum I was using.\n",
      "…read more Saw no difference in my skin’s appearance from using this. And I used it every day until it was used up. The smell and texture are great but it just did not work for me or my skin. Works okay. Worked great the first time I used them, but as I used them more I saw no difference. I recommend them for someone who has pimples with pus in them. Kind of drying and not seeing any skin improvements. I bought this hoping it would help with my extra dry winter skin. It didn't work enough to impress me. I used this under my DE LaLa and I feel like it made that less effective. My skin felt less moisturized when I used this. I will just stick to the Lala in the future. I apply this after my skin care serum as a moisturizer and I love the combo and makes your make up looks so beautiful like a slight natural glow not oily! I really like this serum, it has so many good ingredients and is great for a hydration boost under face cream. It has a nice consistency too. However, after a little over 1 month of use I’ve noticed that my skin prefers the FAB ulta repair hydrating serum. When using the FAB instead of this I experienced fewer breakouts and better hydration. So, bang for buck this isn’t my favorite. It’s a nice luxury serum with many benefits. I will probably finish using it, but not repurchase.\n",
      "…read more It is a good serum but I do think there are better ones out there, I used a full bottle in a six month period, my skin was okay looking, I do not think this is a so called holy grail by any means. Feeling comfortable using this. My skin becomes softer. Hydrating. Just plain serum before moisturizer. Not surprisingly good or bad. Just...good good. But for the price, not worthy. Not worth the hype and I’m convinced they’ve changed the formula as it didn’t dry out my skin a few years ago. Super fragrant - oof - and not hydrating at all. Have to layer many other products to prop this product up. Definitely not effective for dry skin. Bought this as a treat for myself at the holidays, just to see what’s so special, but after a month it doesn’t live up to all the hype and definitely not worth the price. It’s a nice enough syrum, but I’m back to my Shiseido, so much more effective for me. Have tried some lightening products for dark spots but this one doesn't work as well as the others. It takes very long to see results. Have just been using it to finish the bottle. I prefer the murad rapid age serum (US VERSION). That product significantly helped with my dark hyperpigmentation. I had a a dark spot on my forehead and it slowly started fading away. I would sometimes used this product all over my face and at times directly at the darks spots on my face. Hope to worked faster. It does lighten up my skin and erase dark spots, but it makes me break out a little, and breaking out means more dark spots... i am usually a huge DE fan but I have to say this product is just OK. i was looking for a little more coverage and do not feel like it blends as well as i would have hoped. Gentle and didn’t irritate my face but I honestly didn’t really see a difference in my skin. I prefer to use slightly stronger weekly exfoliating products smells amazing. I do not see any radiance but there is even skin tone. It’s just OK. Size I bought the larger size and I’ve had it for a little over a year, if you look on the bottom it’s only good for 18 months and I’ve still got 1/3 to go. I use it 2x a day so unless your taking a bath in it, the small size would do just fine. Quality It feels luxurious! It does have a light scent, nothing too strong and it glides on which I love. What I don’t love is that it feels like it’s just sitting on my skin and not really absorbing and at this price point ( I got the big one ) I expected a bit more from it. Results Expectation? Smoother more radiant skin. I wanted my skin to look refreshed and glowing. I take my skin care a bit more serious now that I’m in my 30’s. What I got... my skin felt soft. No glow, no radiance. I’ve continued to use it because I spent so much on it but that the only reason I’ve stuck with it. Would not purchase again.\n",
      "…read more I love this brand, however i knew something was off when i started to use this serum during the day. I noticed my face got extremely dry and i was using this daily. I also noticed my foundation would separate when i used this serum. Although its safe to use during the day, i personally think its preferable to use at night. I love this brand and didnt want to take off a star. I ordered this serum and was so excited to try it. Unfortunately, the smell of the product was too much for me and I had to wash it off. I thought the odor would disappear after a couple of minutes, but that was not the case. Used the entire bottle and kept waiting for results. I used this over my Genifique serum. Not sure that it made any difference to my skin. I definitely didn't see any reduction in pore size or any change in texture. Will not repurchase. This was one of the first Vitamin C serums I'd ever used and thought it was better than anything else I'd used. Now there are so many that are significantly better than this one. I do NOT have sensitive skin at all but find this to irritate my skin and has a tingling sensation. The cream is also incredibly thick and difficult to spread and sort of has a bit of a slight grittiness? It also has a strong smell. I'm 32 so I use skincare as prevention and not wrinkle reducing at this point, so I can't speak to how effective it is at that. It was too late to return so I use it as a hand cream and neck cream and it does leave my skin feeling super soft the next day. I just don't find this enjoyable to use as a face cream.\n",

Then I got to approximate 1/4 of the bottles left. The pump is not long enough. As well is thick enough for this rich creamy serum to pump onto my hand. I had to resort to tipping the entire bottle upside down. To hope the enough would go to the top. I ended up injuring myself. As the pump was completely useless. Desperately trying to get at least an entire weeks worth of product left.\n",

It was my gateway drug into Biossance, so I’m thankful for that. I have been using this for 3 months and see absolutely no improvements to my skin. It’s hydrating but that’s about it :( I’ll start with the good: Smells good and actually makes my face feel softer. Now the not so good: I bought this because I developed hormonal acne all around my jaw and cheeks that I ended up taking Accutane for. Before the Accutane I tried this, and it did nothing for my acne. That’s it, it just wasn’t effective for me. I raved about this product for the first year because it DOES remove dark spots with consistent use, but I had to stop using for about 4 months as I was using prescription trentinoin and I didn’t want to overload. I started using it again this week, and immediately woke up with small pimples around my mouth - it was deja vu, I always used to get these before, but never seemed to connect the dots. Ask for a sample before committing to full size, make sure this product is for you!\n",
      "…read more Okay firstly, I'm incredibly alarmed at how many people use this during the day and don't use sunscreen. PLEASE USE SUNSCREEN It did blur and minimize my fine lines, not as well as some other products out there for much cheaper than this.I found I couldn't wear makeup over it, was an awful primer. But for my non makeup days it works well. Ok, this product does not actually peel your skin. What you are seeing when you rub it is the product itself pilling. That part is nothing more than a gimmick. That being said, if you adjust your expectations and view this as a chemical exfoliant that will take time to improve your skin, it's not bad. I have used better products for the price, though. I’ve tried many facial peels and this was just not it. Your the the skin is not peeling !!! it’s the product pilling ! It also left my face with a film trying to seem as it had made my skin smoother. I recommend first aid beauty’s peels Personally for me, it didn’t do much with getting rid of my acne. However, I do feel like for the areas in which I applied the treatment were less susceptible to new acne forming- but still did nonetheless. It did a subpar job. I tried for over a month, then tried Murad. Super similar to the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion - almost exactly same ingredient list, but twice the price. I put this on after I clean my face and leave it on overnight. It's a drying lotion, so I'm a little dumbfounded that people are surprised it dried their face out - that's the point of the product. Overall, I would recommend, but note that again, it's twice the price of the MB drying lotion for the same thing. I never wear foundation, so I use this as more of a highlight than a primer. I put it on all of the high points of my face and it gives a 'lit from within' glow. However, it doesn't have a ton of staying power, probably bc its a primer. But, you just want a healthy glow on no makeup makeup days then I think this is a great option. Since I do not use a ton Ive had mine just under a year and it's starting to separate. Meh. Got the same results from the 10 dollar neutrogena pads. For almost 50 bucks i would no rebuy. I wanted to love this product. I really did. Did this product have a lightening affect on my skin? Yup. The type of lightening is a whole different story. I have a few acne scars on my forehead. I bought this product to address that. It didn’t really do that. Instead, this product lightened the complexion on my face. I have a tan complexion. After two weeks of use this product had the effect of skin bleaching agents. Not what I expected.\n",
      "…read more While I loved this product for how light it is, has a mild fragrance I found it not fade any of my acne scaring or increase the radiance of my skin. This is a great product, but the pump never seems to work. There is very little product in the bottle as well, which seems undreasonable considering the price. Despite this, it it great for treating acne scars. I love to try serums, and received a few samples of Murads Retinol serum and loved it, but I wanted a day serum so I tried this. Unfortunately I did NOT notice a difference like the other Murad product. I will not repurchase this serum and noticed zero difference. I've used this product for years it works. So why the stars? Not enough product for the price. I think they're giving less product out. I don't like that and I think I can find another product that's cheaper, works just as well and gives more product. This product used to be my daily routine morning and night! Until, they decided to change or hold back on some of the ingredients. I still have my travel size vs the regular size that I recently just purchased and the smell is just awful!!! The oil seems to be thicker as well. I still love the product, but the smell is horrid. The one thing that woke me up nicely with this product was it's lovely citrus scent, now it just smells like I'm applying cooking oil on my face. I had finally convinced my best friend to purchase this product, and right she had returned for the simple fact that it doesn't have smell right. Smell's like the oil went bad. I understand the Volcanic oil has a natural displeasing scent, but for the Rose Gold Elixir, this wasn't necessary. Too bad.\n",

Was super disappointed it started to smell so bad. Not sure if I’ll repurchase I loved this oil at first and I used to put it on my lips before applying lipstick but the oil got cloudy once I was about half way down and the consistency changed a lot. Not sure what happened but I was kind of disappointed. Okay- this was a hard review because this product helped my skin. It makes me feel glowy. I really feel like the way my skin looks and feels noticeably better since I added this oil to my regimen. THE REASON FOR THE 3 star review- the smell. It literally smells like old grease on the stove. I smell it all day long, and then somebody even told me my HAIR smelled like “cooking oil or grease” when they hugged me. Soooooo like I said, it’s a tough one for me. Great skin but smell like a deep fryer? Is it worth it? I’m really not sure.\n",

I did not see a huge difference in my dark circles and fine lines I believe I am using too many of the products from this line and so when I added this- my skin broke out in small red bumps/ I’m going to use it on my neck. I use their nighttime version of this and that may be enough Too expensive for what it delivers. I’ve been using this product for months and have not noticed any brightening or even moisturizing effects. I’d look elsewhere before splurge on this useless product. On top of not doing anything to my skin, this product also irritates my skin. I think my skin has gotten a lot of sensitive ever since. FYI I used this serum 3-4 times a week after cleaning and toning. Yeah... so I wasn’t as impressed as some of the reviewers on here. I tried a sample that lasted me almost one week. The serum is creamy but lightweight. It goes on smoothly and a small amount of product can cover the entire face, neck and décolletage. I did like the way my face looked when I put on the serum but I honestly didn’t think it did anything to my skin; it’s just that it has an iridescence to it and whatever shimmery particles are in it, they make the skin look like it’s glowing. I can glow by mixing a little bit of shimmer cream or drops into my sunscreen and I don’t have to spend a ridiculous amount on a serum. It’s a good product but I’ve tried amazing ones for less 80 dollars or less. This one is not amazing, it’s just overpriced because of the brand name. No, thank you!\n",
      "…read more Nothing that stands out here. Does a decent enough job hydrating but interchangeable with many other serums. For its price, it is not good enough for me. I don’t mind the stickiness of the serum, but it is not hydrating enough for me and not forming my skin at all. I had somewhat mediocre expectations for this and sadly it did just that. It didn’t leave my skin glowy or feeling any type of way whatsoever. It sinks in very fast (which should be a good thing) but it really didnt feel like anything happened, like it just vanished. I didnt notice any difference on my skin at all. I’ve been using this everyday for the past month and a half. I do however really like the packaging and that there is no scent also the fact that it didnt irritate or cause any break outs. I just wish it did more. Maybe my skin just needs more :) I will continue using it until i finish it but will not repurchase.\n",

The vitamin C does not work well though, I’ve now gone through the whole bottle and I’ve notice no effects from the vitamin c!! I kept using it for the hyaluronic acid aspect of it, but the vitamin c doesn’t work at all. The texture is terrific, but the price is a deterrent. It leaves a lovely mat finish so no greasy residue. Dries quickly there I like it, product lasts a really long time. So, I have nothing totally negative to say about the formula, but also I don't have anything crazy positive to say. It didn't really effect the look of my skin but also didn't cause it to dry out. It's just meh. This is after using a semi full bottle (read to find out why). I think I'm most upset about the actual packaging. The dropper malfunctioned, popped out of the socket and leaked all over my bag. I would say it's a fluke but the dropper won't function properly when closed. I still would recommend the product oddly enough, but only if you don't mind shelling out the money. Worth trying because I do believe it can help people. Maybe it's too early for me to say.\n",

Pro: Doesn't cause breakouts Con: Texture or smell isn't appealing I’ve been wanting to try this for a while but kept going back to my regular moisturizer. Finally bought it and when I received it the bottle felt empty and I had to tilt it to get the product out. Sephora send me another one and again it feels like it’s empty. The products were both done in ten days. It does moisturize as it promises but I wanted to LOVE this since I’m an avid aragon oil user. It’s the same as any other one.\n",

Might just have to use the rest of the product for just the nose once in a while. Also important to note - I really don’t think the smell is that bad! It smells quite medicinal...so if you’re used to using a lot of prescription creams for your face, this smell won’t phase you.\n",

I would not recommend using this on the day of a big event! I felt more hydrated but after a day I started breaking out pretty bad I have really oily skin, but this primer is still too drying on me. Sometimes it produces dry patches under my concealer and makes my skin look more textured than it is. I would only recommend this with a really dewy or hydrating foundation, or the way that I use it, by mixing it with a hydrating primer. I bought this to calm my rosacea but I honestly like Tatcha products a lot better for soothing. Overall I didn’t see too much of a difference in my skin. Felt nice going on and absorbed nice while not breaking me out but no significant improvements for the price I purchased this product because the sales person at Sephora really convicend me to buy it, I had gone into the store looking for an eye cream and I was interested in one by tatcha but I ended up purchasing this product in a gift set that included their celery moustirer as well as the tumeric face and body polish. I loved this product from the first few weeks I could see an instant glow and extra moisture on my skin that was dull at the time and also ove time I realized I took away some of my hiperpigmentation, I was wearing it day and night but now after using it for about 2 months I feel like the effects stopped and it doesnt do anything on my akin amymore which is why I’m giving it 3 stars. Ive added two photos first one was before the product and the other one was after about a month using it two a day.\n",

I purchase this cause I used they are foundation, it was pretty natural, it covered some skin but many people can't tell I put on makeup so I loved the foundation, But the concealer was a little disappointed me, it was thick and not that smooth. I only used less than 5 times its been setting there never touched. I find this product to be OK as a concealer for under eyes or uneven skin tone / slight redness, but it doesn’t do anything for me for treating active pimples, and is also just so-so at covering blemishes up. Wasn’t a fan it was too thick and came on very blotchy This does what it says it does, it hydrates really well, I don’t know if it’s worth the price as I have other products that do the same thing for much less but if you want to splurge do it. Only bad thing is I don’t love the smell and I find it leave a bit of tacky feeling, although it’s not a problem for me because I layer a different serum on top it might be for some people. I realized after I used this that it was the more expensive serum(eek!) that I had sample with such great results. I will finish this bottle and then get the other one next time. I find the scent of this stronger than I would like, but thankfully it is tolerable. I think this is a good product (for oily normal Combo skin) but not for sensitive skin, use caution if you’re sensitive. I am , and it caused burning and tingling and mild redness. Which I did not enjoy and returned it for a diff brand I’m sure this works for some people but I got an immediate break out. If your skin needs the clean clean products I wouldn’t recommend this. My back has been breaking out uncontrollably as of late, and I have absolutely no clue how to make it stop. At the recommendation of Sephora, I gave this a try. I don't feel that it's terrible... the exfoliation is nice. But I have been using this for a month and my back doesn't seem to be improving. I think it's onto something new next time My skin responds really well to glycolic acid and I was recommended to buy this by one of the Caudalie reps that was in the store for an event. It is a nice mask but I don't notice any results so probably wouldn't buy it again. This serum feels nice and sinks into your skin quickly but I did not feel like it added any extra oomf to my routine. I already use and love the time release hydrating rose cream and that seems to do the trick without the serum added to it. I took the sample of deep hydration face serum yesterday and tried. The first time was as night skin care, the second time was morning skin care, before makeup. I had a high expectation at first, because I wanted to try the whitening essence of SK2, but the staff of Sephora said that SK2 is not suitable for me. He recommended fresh. Ok, it doesn't matter, but I always know that fresh is very gentle (meaning nothing feels good to me). As a night skin care, there is no comment written quickly absorbed (I am dry skin) but it is not very moisturizing feeling; in the morning, I used it before makeup,after whole day,I feels it was like a good face primer because it helped me control the oil. The price is not worth it.\n",

Not super hydrating compared to other items. I've had adult acne for a few years now and it continues to mystify me. I used this as a nightly spot treatment for a month, but it did not eliminate my acne. Pros: didn't wreck my skin, no excessive peeling, no strong odor. Cons: I see no difference in scarring/discoloration; I still get acne, though maybe slightly less. I took 2 bottles and I still don't see better. Disappointed but know that no medicine work with everyone. this serum broke me out - even really working on my redness. It was sad but I had to return it, the breakouts were all over and hurting. Still would recommend for somebody who’s not sensitive! Its ok, did not see any difference I bought this to help with some redness on my cheeks. I SO wanted to love this, but I used it once and it immediately broke me out and made my skin all itchy! It's over a week later and I'm still trying to get my skin back to normal. The texture and smell are nice, and it's a clean product which I love, so I'd just encourage you to do a patch test before committing to putting it all over your face.

The heating aspect feels nice, it does feel like a good exfoliator, however I didn’t notice a difference in terms of getting rid of blackheads or preventing them. I had a hard time understanding its usage method from the package's explanation. Had to look for YouTube reviews, which are just a few for a good reason : not only is it hard to get, but it's also its application. However the result after all the fuzz is not bad; it does its job. Would I buy it again? No It's a good product, but it doesn't do what my other serum does. Probably good for younger skin, 20's or 30's. An Instagram blogger I love recommended this product. I like it it smells nice and is plumping but don't expect miracles. I mix it I to my Josie Maran moisturizer it add anti oxidants. Received as a sample, not a bad product, but didn’t really notice much difference. Had a nice consistency and applied nicely, but wasn’t anything really different from other products. I use it morning and night and it's not making my acne worse, but its also not really stopping break outs either. I'm going to keep using it until it runs out because it wasn't cheap, but it's not making that much of a difference. When I first bought this product I was so excited to get rid of the breakouts I have on my forehead. So I used it for a solid 2-3 weeks and it worked really well! Like my acne was completely gone. However, at one point it just stopped working. It was as if I was never even using the product in the first place. I took about a one month break from using it, to see if it would work again. I began using the product again and consistently put it on for about a month. Nothing changed, and my acne stayed the same. I was really disappointed because it was really helping out in the beginning. :(\n",
      "…read more I was hoping this would help control my acne, unfortunately it’s not strong enough for me. My skin is oily and my acne is very stubborn. Once I get a pimple it will be there for at least a week. This definitely didn’t work for me but I’m sure it worked for many other people. Not bad. Added a bit of moisture, but didn't see any difference in my skin after a month of testing I got this as part of the 30-day set and for the first month or so, everything worked and my acne did decrease but then went back to how it was. Before this, I had only tried drugstore salicylic acid and thought that using a higher end salicylic acid product would work but I guess SA is not the cure to my acne. I've used parts of this kit before. I like the face wash. it feels like it drys out the oil. and the salicyclic acid was light and had a slight tint but none of these stopped my breakouts that I would get from time to time . At first, this was a miracle for me. My skin was becoming a blemish free. Yet, I think with constant use, my skin became used to all the products. Which led to no more effective results. It’s a nice serum that feels very hydrating but I haven’t noticed any long term results. Giving this product 3 stars because while it does dry out pimples quickly, its super drying. If you use this as an overnight spot treatment, beware that the skin around the pimple will be red. It also causes flaking skin if you use it too often on the same spot I liked this mask and use it when my skin has a breakout of gets congested, but I can’t honestly say that it does anything more for both issues than a charcoal mask. I also think it’s gotten less effective after a few months, which is not the case for my charcoal masks. I like it but not enough to justify repurchasing for the price. I really want to love this product. I wish I read the reviews about not using this an an overnight mask because I did that last night and woke up this morning to red patches in the spots where I applied the mask. I don’t even have sensitive skin so it speaks to how potent this stuff is. I didn’t find the smell to be unbearable and when I used it as a 20-30 min mask, I felt it did help with my acne. I think I need to figure out how to best use because I do feel it is effective but I’m not looking to get these chemical burns after every use.\n",
      "…read more Before getting into anything else, this mask works very well. I wouldn't suggest it if you only have a few isolated pimples, bit if you're experiencing breakouts, this will really help speed their process along. I love how intense the cooling sensation is while it dries; it definitely feels nice on hot feeling acne. That being said, this mask smells putrid--which is to be expected because it is sulfur--but it even leaves my face smelling like sulfur for hours after. The scent is so strong that it definitely could dissuade someone from enjoying the product's benefits, so I would suggest getting the mini size first. The second star I took off is for the price. I understand that you pay for quality products, but I don't think that the amount of product that you get justifies the pricetag.\n",
      "…read more It's fair?! i am not sure. Pricy? Nope, but the amount is small, so it seems like not cheap if you calculate by per oz. About the effect, I have almost finished one of three, nothing change I believe so far; however, nothing bad at the moment. If someone could reply to this msg, that would be awesome. Please tell me if you are experiencing the same thing .... I put the product on at night and in the morning my acne/cysts scars are MUCH lighter. Then I wash off the product, apply my morning moisturizer and makeup, and then, the scars are back to being super dark. If anyone is reading this and going through the same thing, please let me know and what are you doing to help it?\n",
      "…read more This works with lighter spots, but don't expect a dramatic difference. I used the entire bottle and saw only small differences. Will not be purchasing again, but I plan to try the orange version offered by Murad. Got this as a sample initially and LOVED it. I used half of one of the sample pouches on my face, so really used a generous amount and WOW, I was glowing, hydrated, dewy and flawless. When I saw the cost was $59, I was hesitant at first, and I definitely won’t buy this again. Two pumps really does nothing for your skin, and it’s hard to justify using more at that cost. You want it to last! I haven’t seen any crazy dramatic difference, but I do love how it feels and the appearance it gives my skin. If this was $25-30 I would buy it consistently, but I can’t justify the price for the less than incredible results. I live at 7,200 ft elevation, and it’s super dry up here, so this has definitely saved me and I have used it both with makeup, without and at night, and consistently get soft, hydrated skin. It pairs well with a moisturizer if you’re really needing some hydration, but it’s almost just a fancy primer under makeup. If you’ve got the extra cash, I’d definitely recommend trying this product! The only real negative is the cost.\n",

      "Best cleaner I’ve ever used. Gets my face nice and clean without stripping my face. My only con is the packing due to the cleanser leaking from the nozzle. This product smells good, the glass bottle and pump are great and it does a great job at removing makeup. I took a star off because it's not meshing well with my dry winter skin.

I bought these on accident. I normally get the bamboo ones because I enjoy the exfoliating side...however...while the scent is my least favorite thing about this particular wipe, I have to say I love the way it leaves my skin after I use it. Not dry, not oily, no residue...just right. 4 stars only because of the scent. I love the scents of these wipes! Opening the package gives me a sense of joy each time. These wipes don’t remove all of my makeup plus it feels like a film is left on my face, but I only use them for traveling so it’s not a big deal. One side is VERY HARSH and the other is very soft. Make sure you are using the soft side on your face, as the scrubbing side I found was very hard on my skin. Consistently excellent, takes off my makeup really easily, no oily residue is left behind, and the smell of the Aloe is very soothing. I use as a regular face wipe just as often as I use it as a makeup remover. Sensitive skin types beware as it is a bit harsher than some makeup wipes. Oily skin types rejoice at a moisturizing wipe with no residue. Only issue I have is with the harsh side. I wish it were a bit softer.\n",

Cleaned my face great while on travels. My husband also loved them. It smells pretty good and the quantity is fairly reasonable. However, I think that you need to go over your face multiple times to get a full face of makeup off. I would suggest storing them upside-down to get more moisture into each wipe.

Another use to be holy grail of mine! I use to use up so much though because I needed a lot to keep the breakouts at bay. I would recommend for someone with less oily skin than mine! Great cleanser. Smells nice and not too strong. I deducted a star because for it to be an expensive face wash it should have been made without sulfates and parabens. My daughter and I have tried countless cleansers and so far we keep coming back to purity. It helps keep are faces clear and helps reduce my pores. Another use to be holy grail of mine!

I wear this under makeup and my foundation doesn’t crack and keeps my look looking fresh! I highly recommend! I like it but prefer Clinique moisture surge . Nice fresh scent and feels soothing. I just need more hydration. I was introduced to this product by a Sephora associate during a makeover. I love its lightness and how it moisturizes. But I had the packaging. The vessel for the product is the same diameter as the lid. Whether full-size or in a sample size, 1/4\" of the jar is simply plastic and not product. I feel misled each time I open it. This is my go-to moisturizer when my skin is in serious need of some TLC. I usually use this after one of my scrubs or exfoliators. It’s extremely hydrating and nourishing I love this cream! At first, I was skeptical because my skin breaks out so easily and at an alarming rate at that, but for some reason the soft cream really meshes well with my acne prone combination skin! The only downside of course is the price, but I only have one face so spending a pretty penny on products seems justifiable. I have combination skin, very dehydrated, flaked nose. I put this on twice a day, it's really nice. but the only problem is it takes longer to absorb, so you might not wanna use it in the morning before makeup. I LIKE THE TREATMENT LOTION<- go for this instead~~ I got this as a gift and I have to say, it does work very well. My skin feels super moisturized. I have combination skin and it didn’t make me break out which is nice. But I don’t think it’s worth the expensive price tag. I feel like I get the same results from the Sephora brand moisturizer. Other than that, it’s a great product though! I am 35, and have combo skin that is more parched in my cheeks than oily in my T-zone. Overall, I like this product, but don't love it. While it is moisturizing initially, the hydration doesn't last through the day. I had to add oil (rose hips, marula or the Ordinary's B Oil) into this moisturizer to give it a little more ooph (unfortunately, I look like an oil slick for a few minutes after doing so). Also, I don't see it adding much into my skin. Not as moisturizing as DE Protini or FAB, and doesn't improve my skin like La Mer (don't laugh...I am a skincare junkie...La Mer's soft cream honestly improved my problem area).\n",

I LOVE that it has SPF and like the dewy look it gives me (I know others have described it as greasy but I really think it looks more dewy than anything - maybe others tend more towards matte finishes?). I’m only giving it 4 stars because I’ve found that it can be very tricky to get to apply well and last for the day. I do have acne prone skin with texture so it could just be my skin. However, I’ve found even with moisturized skin and primer the foundation doesn’t always last throughout the day.\n",
      "…read more I made the switch from foundation to bb creams and couldn’t be happier about it. This one lets my natural pinkness show through while smoothing out my overall tone to look even and natural. Only reason for 4 not 5 stars is that I’m very pale and this was just a little too dark on me. I really enjoy the fresh floral smell and the consistency of this moisturizer. It moisturizes well, and I didn’t experience any break outs. I feel like after applying, my skin looks a little more greasy than fresh and dewy, but overall I enjoyed this moisturizer. I think it works better for slightly more mature skin! I enjoy this cream in that it goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and seems to sink right into my dry skin. It has a faint, pleasant scent. It does not irritate my skin at all. It's not as thick going on as it looks/feels and spreads nicely, and actually leaves my skin feeling about the same until it has some time to work. In about 10 minutes my skin feels moisturized. The reason for 4 stars is that I would in no way consider this to be \"intensely hydrating.\" It's calming and moisturizing enough, but nothing intense about it.

I think if you have combo to oily skin, this is good to use once a day but definitely not twice a day It is a lightweight gel and it soaks up fast. A little too fast, in fact. For my dry spots, it doesn’t provide enough hydration... Certainly not 72 hours’ worth. Might be sufficient in the summer though. Got the small size in a set and I really liked it at first. It didn’t sting unlike some other moisturizers and was really hydrating. After a while I realized it was causing my forehead to breakout but I can use it on the rest of my face Great, light moisturizing gel. I have sensitive skin so it can sting a little (I think it is because of the urea in it), but if my skin is hydrated it won't sting and the sting goes away right away. It is GREAT on top of make up (I have dry skin, so sometimes I apply it over my make up where I feel dry and it does not ruin my foundation - just don't rub it in too much! ). Overall a great gel. I think it is better suited for oily skin (mine is dry). I have purchased it three times. I don't use it every day but keep coming back to it when I feel that I need it.\n",

It smells nice, citrusy which is a plus. As for wear I’d say it work very well in moist warmer areas/locations. I think it’s an amazing product to just have for moisturizer plus “primer”. Wait till it’s less tacky to apply foundation and stuff. This product is very lightweight. Makes your face feel fresh and invincible. I just don’t think the price is worth the product. Perhaps I haven’t used it enough to judge that, so I’ll continue with a follow up rating when I finish it. I really like this for no makeup-makeup days! It evens out my skin tone just enough but not too much to look super makeup-y. It doesn’t irritate my skin either. This is a great starter product for someone not yet willing to commit to a foundation (like myself) or someone who wants something a little lighter. It applies great and has built-in sunscreen, which is always a plus. It can be a bit shiny when first applied, but (in my experience) it mellows out with time and gives my skin a lovely vibrancy. I would give it five stars, but I have really sensitive skin, and I think it's giving me a few tiny (like really small) breakouts. That being said, my skin is quite finicky, and hopefully, with the right cleansing routine, I can minimize, if not eliminate, these issues. All the same, others with more sensitive skin should consider approaching this product with mild caution.\n",
      "…read more Such a great tinted moisturizer! The texture is very smooth, and the color i picked out is nice. Coverage is buildable, and it's got a nice finish. Perfect for dryer skin types! I really like this tinted moisturizer, but I wish it came in more colors. As soon as I have any sun, this is crazy light for me, but I usually just finesse it with some bronzer and the rest of my face makeup. It's easy on, and it looks like a light to medium foundation when I use it with the Tatcha Silk Canvas. If you are very dry, then this is a must have. It is thick, but it definitely helps with my flaky skin from Retina Let me introduce you to the type of skin I’ve been battling this winter. It’s my first time dealing with extremely dry flaky patches of skin on my face & neck. It definitely is eczema and I was prescribed with a ointment. However I needed a daily moisturizer that would help me. After trying multiple creams, I thought I found my holy grail. Why do I say that? Because when I first put apply this cream, you can definitely feel the difference of how moisturizing it feels on vs the other creams I’ve tried. It’s a little on the heavy side but a little does not o a long way for me. It kept my face moist for a bit, I definitely didn’t have that “tight dry” feeling on my face anymore. But I noticed I did have to keep reapplying throughout the day because I can see the patches started to flake and feel dry. Even through these past couple days of -30 degree weather, I felt it didn’t do a great job considering I would still flake. Even when I apply this after my night routine and I wake up in the morning, I’m still flaky and dry. I’ve had this for about a week and I’m half way through the tube.. mind you it is quite expensive so I definitely had to find another cream. (Good news I have and I’m going to write a review for it because I actually found something that worked!!) I would say that this will work for someone with dry skin but not extremely dry flaky skin.\n",
      "…read more Ever since I read that dry skin is aging skin - I started to look at my dry face less proudly for the fact that it does not break out. I have been using this religiously - four pumps each morning and night and my skin has softened and become less dry. I rarely break out and this goes beautifully under my daily Maybelline powder. I don't go a week without receiving skin compliments. It is a great BASIC! I received a sample of this and found it to be well hydrating .... but maybe not in the winter. Overall it’s lightweight, not greasy, but not one to slather on when your skin feels tight it’s so dry. I bought this as a sample a few months ago to try for myself and ended up hating it. It made me breakout and felt heavy on my skin. My husband on the other hand has really dry skin with red flakey patches that would never really clear up. I gave this to him to try and it hands down saved his skin. I think 2 or 3 days of using this and the patches/ flaking cleared up. He uses it every day and the patches haven't returned.\n",

Other then that this is an amazing moisturizer with quality ingredients.❤️ I had a small sample of this that lasted me about two weeks. I was very happy with it overall.

IM NOT A TARTE FAN BUT THIS IS GREAT..ITS SO HARD TO MAKE A FULL COVERAGE PRODUCT WITH SUN SCREEN IN IT BUT THEY HAVE.. I really like this products. As I have gotten older, my skin has gotten drier, so using this daily after moisturizer has worked well. The color stays put, looks natural and cancels out some of my redness. I work long hours and can’t manage a full-face look every day, but this stuff really helps me look healthy and put together. Please don’t stop making it! This is my go-to \"foundation\" for day-to-day wear. It feels super light, like silk, but definitely does not last all day. It does a great job of evening out my skin tone and moderately hides blemishes. I prefer it over the Supergoop BB cream. This product had to grow on me but now it's one of my absolute favorites. And I'm a big fan of multitasking beauty products and this is definitely one of them. It's a BB, Primer, and Tinted Moisturizer all in one. I use it mostly as a concealer and primer before I apply my full face. This is as close to perfect as I can find for what I wanted. I wanted a foundation that wasn’t really full coverage and didn’t look like I was obviously wearing makeup and would also not go “shiny” and settle into fine lines an hour after application. But I wanted all of this in a silicone free formula. This does everything I wanted, blurs imperfections and evens skin tone without looking like makeup, wears beautifully all day, acts as a primer to lock in blush/bronzer/highlighter, and keeps skin perfectly matte. However, the silicone congests my skin and that is why I deducted a star. I apply this with a damp beauty blender which works much better than smoothing onto skin with fingers, spreads a thinner more even amount of product which does help create less congestion. I would pay more to get the same thing without silicone!\n",
      "…read more I wear this instead of foundation and works perfectly for my skin and skin tone! I have combination skin. Love this product by target, so quick and easy! Mama of twins and always on the go :) I really hoped this would work for me, but it didn't. It's kind of like a mousse version of Benefit's POREfessional but dries to a matte finish more like Benefit's old Big Easy. I can't wear this on its own on my crazy combination very-dry skin with oily t-zone - it emphasized instead of camouflaging my mature skin. Sigh. Really nice coverage without being cakey, you can definitely build it up in certain areas to a medium/full coverage. My only complaint (as many others have mentioned) is that the shade range is pretty bad, and that the color comes out extremely gray. It does seem to blend out and oxidize to a normal skin tone shade but a better shade range would make this product perfect. I usually mix this with my foundation to wear to work for 8-10 hours and it works great this way!\n",
      "…read more I fell this product is more of a CC than a BB. It is heavily colored and I try to apply it lightly. I do not wear foundation and opt for the very light Coola mineral BB. This product does cover red well and provide even coverage. I love the way this makes my skin look. It gives me that dewy no makeup look and it’s very light weight so you don’t even notice you’re wearing anything. My only complaint is the shade range ( I know it’s not a concealer or foundation but there is room for more than 3 shades ) .. I do however recommend this product. Worth a try for sure. This is by far the best bb cream I’ve tried. The main PRO for me is it does not enhance my extremely dry skin. It hides it so well with a beautiful dewy-ish finish. The only CON imo is the color range. It took me a while to notice because of how shell shocked I was at how good this made my skin look but in pictures on my fair neutral skin even the lightest shade looks way off. :-( appears way way too pink toned but the product comes out gray, very odd. Worth a try, especially if you like to mix base products but that’s my take. I still recommend because Of how good this product makes my skin feel!\n",

Worth the money! Beautiful packaging. I'm not sure If its making a difference. But this is an essential part of my 7 step Korean skincare routine. I have been using this for 4months twice a day. Expensive but generous amount of liquid. Will repurchase for sure. I originally got this as a sample I believe, and I immediately loved it. I got this when I didn’t have the best skincare routine yet, so my skin was very dry, oily, and flaky at the time. Nothing would help my skin texture at, this certainly didn’t help the flakes or anything but it did leave my skin feeling hydrated. I didn’t expect this to be a miracle product to save my skin, but I could tell it would be great if my skin was repaired a bit. I just knew I had to add this into my cart when I went on a skincare shopping binge. And now in combination with other amazing products, I can see the actual benefits from this since my skin has become baby smooth with a soft surface. This hasn’t caused any dryness or breakouts for me. While this is great, I can tell there’s better out there. After a long period, I can feel my skin become oily (and when my skin is oily I feel the slightest itchy/burning feeling) Overall i love it and the cons are tolerable, I just use different moisturizers in my routine to balance it out. I feel like if I used this both morning and night it would eventually irritate my skin.\n",

If you have extremely dry skin, this is not the one for you. AT FIRST I WAS LEFT A LITTLE SHINY AFTER I USED THIS PRODUCT, BUT I STUCK WITH IT NOWWW IM LOVE IT I wanted a lightweight moisturizer so chose this over the lotion and this definitely did the job. I’ve tried better ones though so 4 stars. I’m still on the hunt for my holy grail, but I’d go back to this. One of my favorite moisturizers but it’s not a winter moisturizer unless u have oily skin in the winter unlike myself. I can use this every night. I don’t really see a lot of result with it unfortunately and it’s very tacky. I love many of this brands products so I will finish it up In hopes that it is giving me some benefit but doubt I will repurchase. I thought my neck was hopeless, but since the neck cream I had been using did nothing more than moisturize I decided to try this at the recommendation of a Sephora associate. I had almost no expectations, so imagine my surprise when I found that my neck had tightened up a bit and was looking less saggy. I continued to use this cream - although the odor is really unpleasant - and found that very slowly my neck began to look a bit younger and less like that of a turkey. It may not seem like much, but I'm (ahem) well over 65 and still like to look my best. A little of this goes a long way, so the jar lasts for several months. I'm buying another jar!\n",

I bought this as a sort of “oh gee I might as well try” because I’m afraid of invasive procedures. Weeks later, I’m not the only one who can see a difference. And I haven’t even come close to finishing the jar. Such a beautiful product if you don't mind the price! It made my makeup look melted together and flawless. However, the Morphe setting spray that is way cheaper does the same thing. BUT if you are concerned about natural ingredients, this is a great option! I have combination skin, and in the winter my skin gets so dry. I love this in the winter bc of the dewy glow it gives me and takes away the dryness. I feel in the summer it will be too much on my more oily skin. It’s definitely something worth trying Love this product! The only downside is it takes so much to give the dewy look and it doesn’t come with much product which makes it expensive! I still buy it but have to only use it on certain occasions due to cost. a nice moisturizing mist I use it mid day especially in the winter months when skin dries out quicker. pump spray goes on light so you can control the amount. Solid everyday moisturizer. Not as lightweight as Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream or TATCHA The Water Cream or Clinique Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief or LA MER The Moisturizing Cool Gel Cream. The consistency is similar to Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Day Moisture or clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion With Pump 4.2oz or LA MER The Moisturizing Lotion. It truly is a lotion consistency. I’ve purchased it a couple of times It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. It made a slight difference in my skin’s evenness of tone and texture. In my opinion, you need a serum, peel, or exfoliant for those results, but it didn’t cause any adverse reactions. No breakouts. No sensitivity. No obnoxious fragrance. I’d recommend and a more budget friendly, but still high quality moisturizer.\n",

Deducted a star because I would have loved for it to have a bit ( wee bit ) more coverage. I have to layer it a bit specially on my nose and it’s sides as my skin is a bit red there. But overall a really fabulous product...that too with sunscreen! I bought this in shade 102 which says it's for neutral to cool tones and it leans a little more neutral than cool. I'm an exact match to Cream in Hourglass Vanish Liquid Foundation, but I can make this work and I'm willing to do that for such high SPF. I have sensitive combination skin and I felt that this looked great after the initial application. Halfway though the day it started to become very obvious. I do weird things when testing new makeup to see what will happen, so I sprayed my face with water and used a tissue to pat dry. To my amazement it revived everything and it went on to last the rest of the day with no further issues. Before washing my face for the night (13 hours wear time) I used a wipe and there was quite a bit that came off, so it really stayed on well thought the day. It didn't seem to transfer to any clothing or my baby (he likes to pat my face). For me, this is great. I live in WA state so I don't worry about this getting weird and starting to transfer on super misty days. I also travel to CA, HI, and FL several times a year. I'd be using a refreshing spray in CA anyways, but might be able to skip it in FL and HI. It's winter so can't say if it'll melt in hot temps, but I suspect it'll be okay. Bottom line, if you're very pale with a cool skin tone there are very, very few options for high SPF products (which is insane). This specific color is not part of the Color iq database for whatever reason. But if you match to Cream in Hourglass, or are around NW15-20 in MAC this isn't exactly perfect, but it's close enough it's worth trying.\n",

A lot of skincare junkies will drag jar packaging, but from all the research I’ve done, the preservatives in the formula will more than protect against bacterial growth, and I bought extra spatulas online to avoid dunking my fingers. It’s obviously very expensive, so I bought the large during the VIB sale to maximize value. I really like it, but once I get through this jar I may continue searching for something closer to the $100 range.\n",
      "…read more A very light feeling moisturizer. If you have oily skin I think you will love this. Leaves no residue or slippery feeling on the skin and has brightened my skin! But i do think there are better moisturizers out there for me because i have dry skin. I have hyperpigmentation so I try to get product that have SPF 30. This product is awesome because it provides protection and it moisturizes. The texture is not too oily and not too heavy. It deserves 5 starts, however it is a bit pricy for the quantity. Nothing very great about this but it just works fine so far I like it. I use it under my makeup and over it. Overall, this product is worth the money but there are a few cons I would like to let people know of: first, it’s one of those products that comes in oversized packaging. When you open it you might be surprised about the amount of product inside for the large packaging, but the product matches the amount listed and the container is oversized. Second, it tends to be heavier than other water creams/gels. This is not a large con because it’s great for deep hydration and doesn’t get too greasy at the end of the day, but just makes it more of an overnight moisturizer than one for under makeup. For a high level summary, I have very dry and sensitive skin. This smells nice and the fragrance does not irritate me, but it can be a little heavy if you want to layer it with other products as I do. Great for redness and deep hydration if that’s what you are looking for.\n",

It's better for my oily skin type than clinique 72hour moisture aloe gel, that one sits on top of my skin One of my favourite water gels so far! Got a small one in a value set and fell in love. I feel it actually penetrating my skin instead of just sitting on top and leaving it tacky, unless you use too much. Warm days I’d just use this with an spf, and colder days it works well with water and oil based serums. A bit of tingling sometimes by corners of nose and mouth but never as irritating as other gels. Also I see others saying it didn’t give long lasting hydration, but bear in mind it’s a WATER GEL. You’re supposed to use another moisturizer on top\n",

Oh, did I mention that it also is one of the only moisturizers that helps with my cystic acne? Cause it is. It’s amazing.

I have been obsessed with this for over a year. Curious if they changed the formula recently because this last bottle seems different and doesn’t seem to do anything. I have use this almost daily for the past 2 years. It is a great moisturizer. Its creamy and a bit on the thicker side but that's probably because of the high spf. My skins is more of the dryer side and it works well, not sure it would be good for someone on the oily side. I could say that my face overall looks brighter when I use it, but it doesnt really correct spots, at least not overnight. This moisturizer hydrates my skin the perfect amount.I use to use the tacha water cream before this which would cause me to become oily pretty fast. I don’t know if it has helped my dark spots. It has a nice subtle smell and a little goes a long way. Probably the perfect winter moisturizer but too tacky and shiny for summer. It broke me out where I sweat on the subway...so I got an upper lip break out. It is a nice spf but feels more like one than a moisturizer. It’s a white thick cream that left me shiny until I matted with powder. As much as I like the glow, I was looking for an spf I can wear in place of my makeup powdered spf. This unfortunately still needs powder on top as it doesn’t really absorb, I stayed pretty shiny. Wanted to love it and may try the other versions of this in the winter. There seems to be a couple different spf levels, and age targeting vs brightening.\n",

Helps with fading lines, but definetly wash it off in the morning because I forgot and got some pimples. Other than that great product. I like it a lot, I love how it leaves my skin. I use this in the winter after the Resveratrol Firming Serum and the two together make my skin in the morning feel so smooth and moisturized. I think perhaps it might be too heavy for the summer months except for the very driest of skin. Wonderful night moisturizer for sensitive skin! I love that I don’t wake up with dry cheeks! It does a great job removing makeup as the first step of double cleaning. However, I must agree with other reviewers, it burns my eyes terribly. This is the first cleansing oil I’ve used that burns my eyes. So though I like it, I won’t repurchase, not worth the stinging eyes. This cleanser has been great! I’m making the switch to cruelty-free only and needed a new cleanser to remove my makeup at night. It never stings my eyes or leaves my skin feeling overly dry or tight after.

It keeps your face supple and moisturizer with none of the sticky feel. Can be used all year too. Well I have only been using this product for 2 weeks, it seems that if it moisturizes my skin ... I like that the skin absorbs it quickly and is not heavy. I will not lie saying that I do not get oil, the truth is that if I continue to get oil especially from my forehead but it is that my T zone is surprisingly greasy and what I have noticed is that I have less oil in my T zone but I continue With oil it is in this area but in smaller quantity.\n",

I only put it on at night, and sometimes on my scalp because I have a dry scalp. Probably wouldn't buy this again for the PRICE TAG but enjoying every drop while it lasts. One of my favourite sprays! I was gifted this about 2 years ago and had consistently been using it until a couple months ago. Smells amazing, is incredibly hydrating and does not leave your face feeling sticky. Aside from being a bit on the pricer side it’s incredible! However, I wish Fresh was a cruelty free brand - which is why I have not repurchased. This toner smells nice and moisturizes well. However, I am not a fan of the cost, so I am trying some other toners that are as nice but a bit more affordable. Love the toner (smells great, feels great, not sticky) but the little spray bottle doesn't \"mist.\" It's a pretty concentrated atomizer so it's kind of hard to gently spritz your face.

This product is probably a gimmick and isn’t super noticeably effective but I enjoy the feeling of it and would repurchase to buy into the de puffing and cooling gimmick. It does feel cooling and moisturizing on the skin. Only problem is that it drags and pulls your skin around, which is bad for under the eyes. If you’re a crier, this is a great product. As odd as it sounds, it is great for getting rid of redness and puffiness after crying. I am a stress/angry crier, and it is perfect when I need to calm my face down. So if you know you’re prone to crying or going to see a sad movie and expect crying, throw this in your purse and use it right after. My skin loves Retinol ! This is a beautiful light weight moisturizer. It feels rich and layers well under other products - no pilling. The smell is soft and nice. This product doesn't last as long as I would like so because of that I would give it a 4 star rating. I would buy it again. First off let me tell you that I have sensitive acne prone skin....even in my early 40’s and was looking for something that would help with my fine lines in my forehead and eye area but one that wouldn’t break me out! This cream is amazing! I have had no sensitivity to it from night one. No acne breakout and over the past several weeks of using this, my eye wrinkles have become less pronounced and my forehead wrinkles have become less noticeable. It leaves my skin hydrated and with a nice soft glow. I have combination skin and has not caused me to be oily. I am very impressed with this moisturizer and would recommend it! I searched for a good cream that had the right ingredients to help with aging skin and this one hit almost all the pertinent ones! Only taking 1 star off bc I wish it wasn’t as pricey but you get what you pay for an I realize that there are a lot more expensive creams out there then this one. So go ahead and try it! I do not think you will be disappointed.\n",

HOWEVER, I can’t stop. This stuff is amazing and I notice results instantly after use. The effects on my skin were plumpness, hydration, radiance and smoothing of wrinkles.

I personally have been using it more so on my dry hands and it makes them sooooo soffttt Great product. I have really dark undereye circles that are just genetically there no matter what I do. This product is the best that I’ve ever tried for covering up the dark circles. It applies easily and doesn’t dry out the area. I’ve been buying it for years and continue to go back to it. This used to be my go to product for under eyes, it’s has a great creamy consistency that doesn’t dry out the delicate eye skin, but there is such little product in this pan that it’s not worth the price. There are also much better formulas like the Kevyn Aucoin sensual skin enhancer that again has that natural radiant finish but with wayyyyy more product. Love this! I do not wear foundation, usually just a little concealer but I have been replacing my concealer with this as it's a little lighter weight and it's a game changer. I have freckles that I love and this product does not hide them, it just evens the skin tone out enough to look awake. It is super lightweight so this will not cover the redness of a pimple, but I use in just under my eyes and it's perfect. If you prefer the natural look, you will not be disappointed. I gave it 4 stars because it does tend to crease a bit as it is like a concealer consistencey and I have to mix two shades to get my perfect color right now, wish they had more than three shades.\n",

Not oily and thin and a little bit goes a long way. However, it has that sunscreen metallic smell which i hate. you can't smell it when you first put it on but probably after about 20 minutes you can definitely smell it, which makes me feel like my skin is dirty, even if it isn't. if it didn't have that smell i would give it five stars. Really like it. Saved me from the city sun and from the tropics too. The only downside is that it can make your face a bit too white.

Anyway! I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but I’m torn between 3 This sleeping mask will not transfer to your pillow case, it stays on your face nicely throughout the night.

There is no weird smell, it’s cooling to put on summer nights, but winter nights can be less pleasant cuz the gel cream is cold to touch. I’ve been using this for several years now and it is great for dry skin. Before I started using this I had a lot of dry flaky skin especially on my forehead. This keeps my skin moisturized all day. The price is a bit high but lasts me a long time. I can’t say if it really prevents lines or wrinkles. Love! I’ve been using this stuff for many years and I love it. I use creams at night more than the day, though. So I lean towards the black tea corset cream over this one. If this came in a larger container, I’d probably buy it more often. I love the scent. However I have only had it a short time so I can't be sure how it is working. Wish it had SPF. So far so good. I only use this at nights with my moisturizing cleanser. I hope it continues to do well!

So...a decent winter one for me. If you have sensitive skin and want a moisturizer that is a safe bet - this is for you. This moisturizer soothes your skin as it goes on. It does not sting, irritate, or make my skin any redder than it already is. I feel good putting it on due to the ingredients. I will always come back to this staple even if it doesn’t fulfill all of my needs. It’s safe and does what it’s supposed to do without breaking me out or causing irritation.

This has Vitamin C Ester, so it kept up with my Vitamin C needs, has an SPF and is NOT greasy, and continues to fight fine lines and wrinkles. Very lovely texture and absorbs fast. I would not repurchase simply because it didn't really help much with anything. At the same time it did not cause any issues (which is a HUGE plus for me since everything destroys my skin). I don't use it daily, only after aggressive clay masks or scrubbing. It is definitely worth a try at least once I LOVE THIS OIL. I use it night and day and it has not clogged my pores. It is perfectly hydrating and gentle. Sometimes (in the winter) I have even dabbed some of the oil onto my eyelids. I also use it on my neck! I bought this product to use as my daily moisturizer in the morning. I have combination skin; a very oily t-zone and dry cheeks. I do NOT wear foundation during the week. A little bit goes a long way with this product. It goes on very thick and makes my skin look super greasy at first (probably because of the SPF) but I've found that after about 15-20 minutes, it absorbs a bit and does not feel as heavy or oily. Because my cheeks are dry, I usually start my application there and then work it through to the rest of my face. I actually feel like this moisturizer makes my skin less oily than most daily moisturizers I've tried with NO SPF. (I'm pushing 30 so, SPF is important to me at this point.) I did wear this under a full face of makeup this weekend and did not feel that it contributed to any accelerated or additional creasing, etc. All-in-all it's a good daily moisturizer but again - don't overdo it especially if you do have oily skin.\n",

The only thing that bothers me is the smell which is a bit overwhelming and it is still smellable on the skin at least until the cream is absorbed. It is hydrating and leaves the skin feeling smooth and not oily. Only a small amount needed for the entire face.

This was a really great cleansing oil! The smell to me was a slight almond scent and it was light enough that it didn't bother my sensitive skin/nose. The oil had a thicker consistency than I was used to, so that is why I had to knock off a star. I felt that I had to use more pressure (and i'm trying to prevent premature aging) on my skin to work the product in to break down my makeup. It did an excellent job at breaking down my makeup and sunscreen and it emulsified well with water. I did feel like there was a slight residue afterwards, but I do a double cleanse so it did not bother me too much. The packaging is cute but it would have been nicer if the bottle was not opaque so you could see exactly when you were going to run out. The price was pretty decent for the amount you received.

The smell to me was a slight almond scent and it was light enough that it didn't bother my sensitive skin/nose. The oil had a thicker consistency than I was used to, so that is why I had to knock off a star. I felt that I had to use more pressure (and i'm trying to prevent premature aging) on my skin to work the product in to break down my makeup. It did an excellent job at breaking down my makeup and sunscreen and it emulsified well with water. I did feel like there was a slight residue afterwards, but I do a double cleanse so it did not bother me too much. The packaging is cute but it would have been nicer if the bottle was not opaque so you could see exactly when you were going to run out. The price was pretty decent for the amount you received. This product lasted me about 2-3 months with daily use. Overall, I DEFINITELY recommend this. If you're looking for a cleansing oil that works on sensitive skin, you should give this a shot!\n",

This cream is not good for winter. I have been using this cream for more than 2 weeks, haven't notice any difference on wrinkles yet. Amazing daily moisturizer!! I have combination skin and this does wonders. The price is steep but it’s well worth it. Love how this cream absorbs into my skin and while it is heavier than other creams I have used, it doesn't feel heavy once it has absorbed. It is great for the winter but I will have to see how it does in the heat of the summer before I determine that it is my new favorite! Origins is such a great, clean beauty company. I was looking for a daily moisturizer with SPF, but none really appealed to me for various reasons. Then I found this! It hydrates REALLY well, absorbs quickly, and does an excellent job of protecting my skin from UV rays (bolstered by Maelove’s The Glow Maker serum). It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy, and it layers well over other products. The only thing I’m not in love with is the scent, but it fades once the moisturizer is fully absorbed, so no big.\n",

I don't really see the effect of it but the scent is very refreshing. I purchased this and so far it is hydrating, also works well during the winter. I noticed it kee8my foundation from sticking to dry spots. I would purchase again. Great for oil but sometimes my skin didn’t feel as clean. Helped keep my acne at bay but didn’t do much with new ones forming I like this cleanser. I bought the whole kit (Cleanser, Exfoliator, Mask and Toner) and I have been using it for a month. I felt like this did it's job. It didn't dry me out, but it definitely refined the excess grease on my face. The price is a lil steep, but if you can splurge, go for it. I have an oily t-zone and I’ve been using this just in that area and it has really helped. It doesn’t strip by skin but it also leaves my skin feeling clean. Very cool and refreshing! Bought it because it's a clean product. TBH my hubbie loves it more than me because of the minty smell. I still prefer other face cleaning products. I love this system of skin care however I have so much trouble with the cap on it. Multiple bottles I have bought, including my recent purchase, is so difficult to open the squirt cap. It says to spin the lid clock wise to open and it just simply doesn’t work. Poor design in my opinion. I like it, it was a nice gentle wash. Didn’t strip my skin Been using the extra mild formula and it’s the Best cleanser I have used, does not dry out my skin. Used the mild cleanser before, but it would leave me a little tight and dry. This one does not. If you don’t have super dry skin you should stick to the other formulas since this might feel too oily. Gets rid of all the makeup really well! No breakouts with it and I have acne prone skin. I've used a whole bottle, which is quite a feat. I have very sensitive, combination, and acne-prone skin with crater pores and this product cleanses well and leaves my skin feeling slightly plumped and well hydrated. I don't wear makeup, so I can't speak to how well it works with makeup removal, but it does clear pores very respectfully when used with one of those cheap, silicone face scrubbies. It gets 4 stars only because it doesn't do much else in the way of improving skin. It doesn't even out my tone or clear acne or reduce pores, but it didn't make anything worse or cause any reactions and for me that's enough for a win. I found this to be a great day-to-day cleanser and it doesn't interact poorly with any toners or treatments or serums, so it's been great as an anchor product when I'm trying out new items in my regiment. Would absolutely recommend if you need something that will consistently work and won't give you any hassle.\n",
      "…read more I have tried *many* cleansers for my sensitive, stubbornly dry but then randomly super oily skin with occasional (but aggressive) breakout fits. Finally I have a routine that seems to be working really well for the past year. On most days I double cleanse with an oil and then the Kiehl’s. When I don’t wear eye make up this is all I use for the face. But typically I wear a little concealer under the eyes/where the pimples du jour are, eyeliner, and blush. It’s not a lot of make up but I still love melting it off at the end of the day with an oil. Right now I’m using the Tata Harper Nourishing Oil Cleanser but was using coconut oil before. I rinse that off with water, and follow with the Kiehl’s and it feels like a nice balance. Be mindful of how much you use. A little goes a LONG way. At first I think I was using too much and it started to feel a bit drying. Love the gel to foam action! Oh, it will last you forever. I have had the 7.7 oz bottle for over a year and it just won’t quit.\n",

Was surprised at how little product there was in the tube. Feels nice and minty. I bought this scrub before I went on vacation to help get any dirt or impurities out (I have oily skin for reference), as I was going to a very sandy destination. This scrub did it's job, it removed any sand or dirt from my face and left my face feeling clean but not tight. The warming sensation that occurs when you massage the product in is also nice, and helps the product emulsify more so it is not so rough on the skin which is a plus. I did not use it everyday, but the packaging states it can be used everyday. Overall, I'd recommend the product, it is a good basic scrub.\n",
      "…read more Smells lovely. I notice my skin is so much smoother and soft. This smells like a spa-like escape. It is very relaxing and enjoyable to use. The reason I give it four stars is because it seems to melt into my skin a little too quickly. I don’t get a long enough chance to massage the granules into my skin before they disappear. So it’s a short polishing window. It goes on warm and enjoyably so, and then cools and cleanses. I had a little texture on my forehead, so I decided to do something about it. I used the Tatcha (the deep cleanse) along with this scrub, and the Tatcha (the water cream) and wow! The results in the morning were very much desired! Definitely recommend to anyone with oily/sensitive skin! I'm on my 3rd bottle of this which is impressive because of the way I rotate through all kinds of crap I don't need to put on my face. For some reason, this toner is soothing, placating my fussy skin like no other. Recently, I tried to branch out into 7 skins territory, sampling all kinds of eastern and western potions only to come running back to this one, head hung down. I don't feel like I should have to spend so much on a liquid and will literally cry watching my paycheck sprinkle out onto a cotton pad. The essence is fancy water, but this is sorcery. Acids are so far down the list that I don't expect exfoliation and if I wanted a burn, I will grab some P50. This is just normalizing water for my skin which in some regard, is priceless...but don't tell my boyfriend what I just spent on toner, both concepts are shocking to him.\n",
      "…read more Love SK II but i broke out shortly after using this. Not sure why so i discontinued and returned. I sooo wanted it to work bc I so believe SK Ii products provide great benefits but something didnt agree with my sensitive skin. One less star due to the price but a lovely toner. Noticeably clearer and smoother skin after consistent use of this product. Does one need to pay $76 for a toner? Probably not, but after going through several travel bottles that come bundled with the Essence Set im completely sold on this. Keeps my skin clear and balanced without drying out my skin and the little extra Pitera is always welcome before I use the Facial Treatment Essence which is probably one my favourite products ever. Permanent spot in my regimen. I like the product. Makes skin feels nice, makes it more smooth and even toned. What I don’t like is the price and the smell. The product has a unique smell, almost like vinegar, sour, smelly feet. It’s not too potent to make you not use it, but definitely caught me by surprise. I am not sure if I can see any changes on my face but this toner is very subtle and perfect for my very sensitive skin. It does calm my skin. I think this toner is very similar to sk11 clearing lotion. What I liked: The smell on this product is amazing, I love how good it smells. *I find the scent very calming for the night time* It made my skin very smooth and helped with my redness and helped fade my scars. What I didn’t like: Before using this toner I was using the ORIGINS mega mushroom toner which contains 6.7 fl. oz for $35.00 (this toner was great, it had an earthy smell to it and also helped with redness and hydration) but I decided to try Amorepacific since I heard really good things about it but the thing that disappointed me was that the bottle tricked me, it was very huge and thought “wow $50 for a lot of product not bad” but then I found out it was only 3.4 fl.oz they really like to trick ppl with bottle sizes/packaging :( I bought this product on July 25th and i am running out already and it’s August 21 * I use this product day and night. Overall I would recommend this item since I did see results and enjoyed it! Just the amount of product you get makes me a bit upset I would of done a comparison of the origins bottle but I threw it away already.\n",

After several years of dealing with adult acne I finally realized that I had been treating it the wrong way. I came to a realization that I had dry acne prone skin after believing for a long time that I had oily/combination. The strong AHAs and high pH cleansers I had been using were irritating my dry skin and causing me to constantly break out with pustules. I change my cleanser to an hydrating one, switched to this Amorepacific treatment toner, layered it with vitamin C, the ordinary niacinamide and moisturizer. My skin has never been better! Being African, I got lots of dark spots from my previous skincare routine but now I only have a few left. I only break out during that time of the month. I am currently looking out for an alternative as this runs out very quickly, I am now on my second bottle.\n",

I enjoy the light fragrance and it leaves my face clean and refreshed. I knocked it down a star for being somewhat drying. I only use this a few times a week, and only a pea-size amount. The rest of the week I cleanse with the La Mer Micellar cleansing water. I read another reviewer who commented on the instruction to avoid the eyes. As I understand La Mer reps only recommend products specifically formulated for the eye area to be used around the eyes period. Which in this regiment is the Micellar water for cleansing.\n",

It doesn't overly dry your skin (i have oily skin), and it has helped to speed up the clearing of my breakouts. Its just a bit expensive. I'm sure there are other cleansers likes this for a better price. Its green, with little exfoliating beads in it that I also like. It turns into a foam like texture when wet and a little goes along way. I swear I had this bottle for over a year. Noticeable has decreased the size of my pores. This light exfoliating cleaners has changed my skin for the better, overall has brightened my under eye dark circles and has made my skin unbelievably smooth. I use it 4/5 times a week following up with a serum. I wouldn’t say it’s the most “hydrating” cleanser I’ve used but it beats quite a few. Overall I give it a 4/5!!! I received the age reform aha/bha exfoliating cleanser and I loved that so much I bought the full size. This is the hydration, but this is nice as well. It's great to use this as a follow up cleanser but if you have a full face of makeup, this will not remove everything completely. If I don't have makeup and I use this as a normal cleanser, it leaves my skin soft. Not the best as a deep cleanser. It is very hydrating!! I have a very sensitive, dry skin. I needed something that would exfoliate my face without the beads burning my face. This was manageable for my sensitive skin. Love the light scent and it does the job of hydrating after washing the face. Its a plus that its a “clean” product. Husband also loves it. I tried this product based on reviews and I liked what I read. I’ve been using this product for almost a month now and I notice that by being consistent, it keeps my skin looking radiant, free of zits on my face, and it’s super light. Doesn’t dry out my skin at all. My face feels super smooth. Only thing is that the smell of it is a bit unpleasant. Must be because it’s natural and plant based?? I don’t know but it has a bit of a funky smell. Other than that, I’m happy I pitch’s this product.\n",

Wouldn’t use daily as it is a bit drying but overall is an excellent cleanser ! I bought this when it was 50% off, so my expectations weren’t quite as high but I am very pleased with this cleanser! It’s very thick, so it’s worth taking the time to really emulsify it in the palm of your hands before applying to the face. I love the lather it makes, and it really does remove makeup well. I typically use an oil cleanser before a gel, but I can get away with just this if I’m feeling lazy. It doesn’t strip my skin, or make it sensitive, although looking at the ingredients there are quite a few surfactants. I might not recommend this for some with super sensitive skin.\n",

They’re clean, lather, are gentle, moisture balancing, non stripping and I always feel like my face is fully clean afterwards.

One of the best scrubs that my daughter has tried so far! I like these. However, I feel like either my skin has changed or the formula has changed. This last package I bought isn’t working for me as well as in years past. Smells like an orange creamsicle. Cloths are a lot larger than I expected, but are alittle rougher than I'd like.The plastic opening clicks closed and has a good seal. These smell amazing and for that reason I'll probably buy again. I've always used Neutrogena's make up remover wipes but wanted to try something cleaner. These aren't as hydrating and smooth, but nothing a follow up moisturizer can't fix which I've always done anyway. Several brands of wipes burn my sensitive skin and cause redness, but these don't do that. Will purchase again. Really great for removing makeup, and for freshening up your face before moisturizing. It has a subtle citrus smell and is super soft on the skin, but as it dries definitely don't forget to moisturize! It truly cleans your skin of any oils and everything, so you will feel dry if you don't use a moisturizer afterwards. These wipes are so heavenly! They smell so good and leave my face feeling refreshed, bright and glowing... the results are pretty instant! My only concern is they don’t remove make up that well. I generally use these after my make up and face has been cleansed or first thing in the morning to leave me feeling fresh! Would recommended! These wipes are so moisturizing and smell so fresh! They take off my eye makeup better than any wipe I have ever used before. I find this to be an effective cleanser but it does seem to be a tad irritating and slightly drying. Before this, I was using a cleansing oil so the formula switch might be effecting my skin a bit. If this is a formula you enjoy, I would recommend this as an option, but if you are used to a balm or an oil I’d stick with that. For some reason I was under the impression this is more an oil, while it is actually a gel or traditional liquid.\n",

It sticks to all of my hair on my checks (closer to my ears) and I almost feel like I have to use a warm towel to get them off completely, but I don’t like to drag a towel across my face because it’s obviously too abrasive. I have found using this product in the shower is better because you can just put your entire face under the shower head to rinse it off. The only reason I can’t give it a 5-Star rating is because of the difficulty removing the product.\n",

      "…read more Although I initially liked this exfoliator, it became too abrasive. I like to exfoliate 3-4 times a week and this product is a little too harsh. The formula has large granules that seem to tear the skin causing irritation and even pimples. If you purchase this I would recommend using it no more than 2 times a week and try not to apply too much pressure to the skin when exfoliating. This helped my acne very much! I recommend it. It made my acne go away but now it is starting to come back :( Absolutely worth it! I use one in the morning and then the other at night and my skin is so smooth after using and doesn’t feel dried out. My husband even made a comment on how much he loved it - after ONE use!! I’ve been using one of these these every night for about a month and like them more that I thought I would. I use the juju less frequently because my skin has been dry, but it is great for post micellar cleanse on the one or two days each week that I wear full makeup. Since using them I’ve been less prone to breaking out after wearing makeup. My skin is combo, oily nose and chin with dry neck and normal everywhere else. The bars haven’t gone down much in size, so I estimate them to last at least 6 months since I still use a foaming or gel wash in the morning. Full size is a better value if you use only one formula and use it twice a day, but I would rather have the small bars to get the variety and a fresh bar more often. We have hard water and I found that these leave skin feeling surprisingly clean without any oily or talc type residues left behind. When they run out I will repurchase. Both bars fit together well in a travel soap dish.\n",

Using it twice really made my skin dry so definitely not gentle! The combination really works! I have normal to dry skin and the exfoliating bar makes my skin peel a bit. Used twice so far but usually that’s when I know if I like something or not. It’s exfoliates my face quite well and it has a lovely smell! You don’t need much either which is good seeing as how it’s over 30$ and it’s only a small little tube. Not quite sure why the wooden piece is included because mine came off after only being in the shower for a few days. Oh and it’s easy to squeeze out which is a must for me! Pretty good exfoliator. I wouldn’t say holy grail status but it gets the job done. Whenever I feel my face is looking dull or my pores are congested this is my go to for a really DEEP scrub. But beware, the granules may be small but if you scrub too hard you can definitely do some damage! Like it, gentle and skin feels clean after use, but don't think it does any \"deep cleaning\" or \"exfoliating\" so won't be buying again because didn't feel worth it. At first, I was not impressed. I used this about 3 times, once a week and did not notice a difference. I really wanted to like this product so I was consistent, even started to use it 2-3 times a week. That is when I fell in love. I have a lot of black heads/pores around my nose and chin area. After using this product my blackheads are gone, my skin in smooth and my pores are not nearly as noticeable. The only thing i wish was different was the smell, it isn't the best smelling product. But it really does the job.\n",

They are soothing on the skin and feel super refreshing. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and they are great for if I am too lazy/tired to wash my face or traveling. Nice cleanser and works very well with Foreo Luna! This cleanser will always have a place in my heart. It’s a perfect way to wash off after a sweaty AM workout. My skin feels soft and revitalized after application! Highly recommend. Personally I love Clinique however I am disappointed with this I have acne and very sensitive skin if this sound like you I do not recommend. The “cleanser” did not truly clean my skin I still had dirt or foundation coming off on the towel also the exfoliation grit in side was nice for physical removal of dead skin but not for a daily uses and not if you are like me and have acne.

I thought the bottle just ran out until I decided to cut it open and see how much was left inside just in case. As you can see by the photo, I was able to fill an entire travel size container with product that was left over inside!!\n",

Classic, can’t go wrong for all skin types in my opinion. You can really can scrub your face with it and it leaves your skin so smooth. Might be able to find a dupe for cheaper. This Clinique Clarifying Lotion 3 is a very effective exfoliating toner that minimized my breakouts and completely eliminated any pore-clogging oils and dead skin on my face... It gave me a clearer complexion within a week, and my skin absorbed my moisturizer much better as a result. My only complaint is that this did sting my face a little while applying, so I wouldn’t recommend it for sensitive skin... But overall, I liked how easy it was to use and apply this product. Plus, the small deluxe sample bottle lasted me much longer than expected... I am just now about to finish it after over a month of daily use, so a little goes a long way with this. It’s a great value whether you buy it as part of their 3-step system or decide to use it solo. I recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable skincare routine, especially because Clinique makes 3 other clarifying lotions depending on your skin type.\n",

Smells like I stuck my face in a lavender essential oil. Very good for sensitive skin-haven't seen a difference in my redness from dryness, but I like that I can count on this cleanser to be gentle. My cheeks are normally pink and my skin is very sensitive. For the longest time I was looking for a product that would ‘cool’ my face down but keep it smooth and soft. I’ve been using this product for almost 2 years and I don’t think I’ll ever switch my cleanser. The only reason I rank it 4/5 stars is because the pump is finicky sometimes (be careful not to pump out too much product!). Unlike others- I have not experienced the wipes drying out- I am on my last wipe, and they all stayed moist- I just made sure to seal the top every time I pulled a wipe out. In my experience, all of my makeup comes off- it does leave a bit of a film on my face, but it goes away quickly. I notice when I wipe my mascara off, it makes my vision go a little blurry, so I try to wipe off my mascara with something else, and then just use these on the rest of my face- they seem very effective.\n",

It is ok, I can see why people like it a lot but personally I think a Muslin cloth works better. I didn’t love it or hate it, it was just an indifferent type of product for me and was nothing special about it to make me keep it. It feels nice on my skin but I give 4 stars because the scent is too strong for me. For those who's not a bid fan of scent may not like it. Will I buy it again, I would say no because of the scent. P.S. it smells nice, just too strong to me. Smells great, feels luxurious. I use it before my avene light moisturizer. Or even right after using a spot treatment. I’ve been using this product for as long as I can remember. I have incredibly sensitive eyes and I cannot use just anything because I wake up an allergic mess the next day. I will usually use this AFTER my make up remover. This doesn’t quite do the job of removing make up. But used with the Clinique cleansing balm or after the Farmacy balm it is perfect. Is you have allergies to oils, fragrance or dyes this is your go to.\n",
      "…read more This product works extremely well for cleaning my skin and really getting everything out. The only thing is that it leaves my skin pretty dry, (however I do have dry skin to begin with). Long as I moisturize right after it's not an issue I thought it worked well! It never dried out my face and it seemed to help brighten my complexion. I absolutely ADORE citrus smells, and the smell of this cleanser is to DIE for. Like grapefruit candy! Other than that it's a pretty basic cleanser -- not too drying, not too greasy, leaves a little makeup behind for my toner to pick up -- but I could smell this stuff all day long! If you're a diehard fan of citrus, it could be worth the splurge. I got this product about 2 months ago and it has helped my skin so much! Although when I got it I didn’t know there was mandarin oranges in it so I was very confused about the smell of it but it is totally amazing Would recommend to people with oily skin. However after using it several days in a row it does dry out my skin. But if i stick to three times a week my skin feels buoyant and amazing. This is a great product. I don’t need it every day. Sometimes it seems after wearing makeup and even though I wash it off ever night my face just feels like it has extra oil ready and waiting to produce those pimples. This takes care of that. At least for me it does. It will dry your face out if you use it too much. So far I’ve been using this for three weeks and it feels great!!! It has a freshness feeling which def a big plus. I can’t tell if it helped my pores yet but I’m still using it just to see how it ends up and I cannot wait! My face feels clean and fresh after using as step 2 in my skincare routine.

I typically spritz 2 pumps into my palms and pat into my skin after washing my face with warm water in the mornings. I found this very enjoyable to use overall, but I didn't notice any sort of results. It restored some moisture after washing but that was about it. It does have a distinct jasmine/floral scent, so I'd avoid if you are sensitive to those fragrances. I did really like the glass packaging though. While I enjoyed using it, I don't think it's worth the price. I recommend it if you are looking to splurge\n",

This completely and instantly balanced my skin tone (I suffer with natural cheek redness) and hydration (who knew I was this dehydrated until using this!).

      "…read more Product itself is fantastic. Easy to use and really gentle on the skin. Very good for removing makeup. The bottle design is infuriating, and causes the cleanser to leak out the top and dribble down the sides, which functionally means that the bottle is covered in oil at all times. I think I may just transfer the contents into a better dispensers, as the cleanser itself is fantastic. LUXURIOUS! this oil is amazing for the first step in my double cleanse, really takes everything off and smells so lovely!! must have in my routine Bought this for my baby. His skin feels super duper polished and looks more clear. He's now purchasing a bunch of products from this line! Really good product overall. I use it once or twice a week. Main concern is it has a strong mint smell. Mint is not good for your skin so I had to deduct a star. I will continue using this because I dont wash with it daily and it doesnt stay on my skin for long, but hopefully some day they will offer a milder scented version because the scrub is great. these take off my face makeup really well and work fairly good for eye makeup too. I have really sensitive skin, I can never use any cleansers or makeup wipes because they always break me out! But these have yet to disappoint. I love these wipes! The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they were a little dry this time. I like these clothes in the morning when I don’t have makeup on and want to quickly wash my face. They are gentle and don’t irritate my VERY sensitive skin. The only thing I find is they are a bit dry so I just splash some water on it first before using. I keep these with me to use after going to the gym in the mornings - wipe off all the sweat. They work well and leave my face, neck, and decolletage feeling refreshed. They are a good size and haven't dried out even though I keep them in my car, in summer in Atlanta, sometimes. Only four stars because I'm not a fan of the smell, and that is something philosophy usually nails. Also, the more sensitive skin on my face sometimes feels like there is a light film on it after using these. I'll probably look for another wipe next time, but I would re-order in a pinch.\n",

The only thing is it can be a bit drying so I have switched to a more hydrating moisturizer This is a pretty good cleanser! My skin feels super clean and soft after I use it. It is a bit drying but as long as you moisturize after it's fine. Excellent cleanser! I have extremely reactive skin due to autoimmune issues so I am always nervous trying a new facial product. I either get a rash or a major breakout and this little gem didnt cause me any problems at all. I was previously using Lush coalface but they changed their formula so I had to seek out an alternative. It was a happy accident because this is so much better on my sensitive skin. I have been using the clear cpmplexion moisturizer for years and can't live without it. If everything breaks you out this is worth a try. Very nice foam and highly concentrated so you need very little product each time. I do wish the bottle was transparent so you could see where your supply was.

I would recommend if you have dry sensitive skin that sometimes breaks out a little. I have congested combination sensitive skin. Cleans well like gel, red clay helps with removing oil, but does not make skin super tight. mild enough to use twice a day. Must follow with mosturizer This is gentle on the skin but also cleanses very well! My skin has definitely improved since I started using this cleanser. Works great with my cleansing brush! The product itself is good. I really it working-- makes my pores smaller and skin more even. Downside is packaging-- the silver paint comes off the cap during every use. I'll returning it for this reason and hoping it's just this bottle and not the entire line. Third time buying this toner and it is far better than any other toner I have used. If texture is an issue for you, then meet your new toner. It exfoliates without stripping or drying. If you don’t want a lot of serums, scrubs, etc than get this toner. My only problem which is my skin not the product I had rash and this was a little much when my skin was more sensitive. Haven't seen a huge difference yet maybe my skins a little smoother i think you can get a toner just as good for less money not bad just ok Bought this product as a 'gentle exfoliator' and I'd say it's doing its job largely. I use it about 2-3x/ week, at night, otherwise if I use it more, it can be really drying. Didn't really see results re \"skin brightening\" and shedding away dullness, hence my 4 star rating. I have been overall pleased with this product. (in my experience) Peter Thomas Roth delivers effective and noticeable results. This product leaves my skin feeling renewed. Purchased these because the store was all out of the Sephora brand.. I really like the packaging and the sheets come out 1 at a time which is really handy and keeps it organized. The sheets work great and remove oil from my face. The only thing I don't like is that they are scented... not sure why as this doesn't benefit it at all.. so if you don't like scented things.. pass on them. I use these daily on my combination/oily skin when I need to \"refresh\" my makeup. These are not any better than other blotting sheets I've used but the packaging is good, it allows me to pull one sheet at a time and one sheet is enough for my entire face. This brand is also at a better price point than some other brands I've used. I just wish it was frangrance-free. These sheets work as intended. I got these because they don’t have any added ingredients like mineral oil. Good for soaking up excess facial oil and sweat. One star off for the price, but otherwise a great choice for us oily folks. The sheets are nice and large, they don't remove my makeup with the oil. I am used to using the blue colours oil absorbing sheets from the drug store. Compared to those, the transparent colour of these makes the absorbed oil more difficult to see. They do have a light, pleasant scent. Ok, gets the job done I love this product. I feel like I have combo skin. The areas around my nose and chin get oily and my cheeks are kind of dry. This product doesn’t over dry my skin and doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight. It does a good job of leaving my skin feeling clean and helps fight breakouts. I only gave it 4 starts because it doesn’t foam up at all This product is great for oily skin. I found that this helped clear most of the oil out every time I used this. This can be also used for people with sensitive skin. However, I bought this product mainly to get rid of my acne, it did not help that much. A very gentle but effective cleanser. I’ve been using it everyday after The Polish and since the first time, my skin feels amazing. Soft, hydrated and very clean. It’s a great end-of-the-day product as it removes eye makeup very well. Also, the scent is fantastic. This cleanser rocks!! Alittle bit goes along way, I used it with my Clarisonic. I could feel the deep clean, but it did not dry my skin out, which I was extremely happy about!! A little goes a long way with the Cleanse. I've used it after the Polish and it cleans my skin leaving it refreshed without any dryness or tightness. When used in combination with the Polish, my face always feels silky smooth afterwards. The Cleanse also works well on it's own as a second cleanser. This cleanser does a really good job of taking your make up off and making your skin feel clean and soft however you have to rinse a couple times it almost has like a lasting soapiness that doesn’t come off like other cleanser ive used but this whole Lancer system is really great definitely worth a shot Light, not Too coarse but gets the job done, perfect before applying makeup I have only been using the scrub for a couple of weeks, but I really like it. It truly is gentle on the skin. The one problem is sometimes I don't feel as exfoliated as I expect to afterwards, but that may just be because I'm so used to harsher exfoliants. Really good product though and no heavy scent! Great scrub. Gentle enough to use everyday very gentle, great for winter when I need a little more hydration. I use this as a multi-purpose cleaner... lazy AM or PM when I'm not double-cleansing, before the gym to wipe off make-up, after the gym to wipe off sweat before heading home to the shower. It does its job to clean off everything, and the formula really goes a long way. Sometimes I rinse it off, and sometimes I don't, and it doesn't seem to make a difference in terms of the effect on my skin. I will say it takes a bit longer to dry up before applying a toner or essence afterwards (compared to some other micellar waters) but it is also more hydrating so you could use it as a standalone and not have your skin feel dry.\n",

The trick with micellar water is that if you hold down for 5-10 seconds it will start breaking down hard to wash off makeup. Then swipe (lightly!!) all over face, and proceed to oil cleanser, and then foaming/gel cleanser. Basically, I use micellar water to breakdown hard to wash off make up, I use the oil cleanser to clear the foundation out of my pores, and then I use foaming/gel cleansers to actually wash my face. I remember that once I started doing the korean beauty double/triple cleanse, I noticed a lot less inflammation and acne on my face. I also use this with cotton pads when I wake up in the morning if I don't want to completely wash off all my skincare from the previous night but still want to clear my face from pillow and blanket particles. I have no idea what the old formulation was like, but I do think this has pretty clean ingredients. The bottle is super annoying and finnicky though, there's always a small amount that hangs around and squirts out whenever you try to put the cap back on.\n",
      "…read more My face feels fantastic after using this. Some have commented on the fragrance. I have never used the previous version, but I find that I really like the floral smell, it's sort of like thayer's rose petal toner. I can see how some might feel their face feels sticky after. I do as the bottle recommends and do a quick rinse with water after using, then I pat dry. My skin feels very moisturized after this, and I no longer need to put on moisturizer after applying curology after this, which is fantastic.\n",
      "…read more Even though I have dry skin, I prefer this one to the hydrating toner, I don't see too much of a difference between the hydrating one and this one and I prefer the scent for this one. It's a pretty solid toner option given the price. I really love the fact that you can spray it on because its the best way to get full coverage without overdoing it. While I don’t dislike this toner, I don’t love it. While it made my face feel fresh, I found that my acne was aggravated almost immediately. It’s a shame because it smells great and makes my skin feel nice! this is a great product. I have oily and acne prone skin and this has helped me immensely by controlling the oil. It has also helped brighten my face and it feels very refreshing and smells amazing. loved it Not the greatest scent but it does the job! This is an amazing toner for brightening. I used this as my spring into summer routine and had good results. It's such a nice citrus smell, and citrus really lifts my mood so I would recommend it for that alone. It doesn't dry out my face and I put a healthy amount on. I have noticed a good change in my skin but I've been using other new products and I don't think this spray is a big contributor. Overall, I will buy it again because it's refreshing to spray on my face daily and will have it as more of a self-care ritual. I love the smell of this, it’s a very cooling cucumber/seaweed scent. Doesn’t do much for my skin as far as clearing it up but it’s a nice face wash to use for daily cleansing. Good smelling thick texture which cleans well even taking my mascara off. I have oily skin and still had some breakouts with this. No dryness though. Just finished the bottle and it lasted a year and four months with regular use. Overall pretty good and minus the price and some breakouts. While la mer at first seems pricy, only a little gel is needed per use making it a very worthwhile purchase. The smell of the sea is very soothing and it gently cleans and brightens the face; however, having sensitive skin I do not recommend using this more than once a day. Nonetheless, probably one of the best cleanser available on the market! love the texture of this product but holy cow it’s fragranced!! it smells like my grandma’s favorite kitchen cleaner haha (which i actually like the smell of). hopefully i will notice it less over time as i want to really love this product because the texture has just been great and it feels like it really hydrates my skin! this is the first cleansing milk i've tried. it made my hand feel soft in the store so i got it. i definitely prefer it over drugstore cleansers, mainly because it's easy to rinse off. i've been using it for about a week and i've gotten three pimples since then. make of that what you will. I overall really liked this product, it's very hydrating, it literally UNDOES some of my dry patches even better than exfoliation does. I used to have oily skin that, but as I get older, it becomes more combination, so I need a cleanser that will hydrate my skin without triggering my cystic acne, and this product does that. I think the price is reasonable because it lasts a long time, the product going a long way due to its balmy texture. Two important things: you need to use a cleansing oil/makeup remover before using this product. It is not strong enough to get the dirt and grime off your skin without a pre-cleanse. Also, trying to scrub your face aggressively after using the product with only irritate your skin. Wash it off as best you can and then go in with a toner to clean off the rest of the product. The only real problem with this product is that the first time I locked the pump to travel with it, I lost the ability to unlock it again, so now I have to take the tube out to wipe it on my face which isn't sanitary. If you want to travel with this product or don't use a pre-cleanse, you'd probably want another cleanser, but I thoroughly enjoy it, and I'd recommend it to people with combination or dry skin.\n",

It feels really refreshing on my skin. I instantly noticed any big differences in my complection. I love how this toner works but the only issue here is how strong the scent is. It's very perfumey, but I would probably buy this again. Just wish they made one that was lighter scented or unscented Feels hydrating like the pyunkangyul toner I used previously. Does have a scent, but not overpowering. Though I did seem to break out using this (not terrible though). Better than I expected! Very happy with the rich texture. It's helping me to keep moisture before I applied moisturizer. I've been using this toner for a little over a month and I have to say I like it a lot! However, I probably would prefer it for the winter time given its consistency and preferred application technique. My skin definitely feels moisturized and soothed. My only problem is that since I apply my morning skin care before I apply makeup (I've been doing this for years with no issue) I all of a sudden have issues with splotchiness under my eyes with my concealer/foundation. Therefore I do have to be careful about where to apply it often times just foregoing it altogether.\n",

I've started to put it in a bottle I have for another product that uses a pump instead and it's lasting much longer now. I like it! I can definitely see improvement in my skin. My skin looks more smooth & less oily. I would definitely recommend. It has a pleasant, mildly medicinal smell to it. I put mine in the fridge so when I apply it, I get an extra sense of refreshment. I’ve been using it for about 2 years now and definitely notice a difference in my complexion if I miss a day. Is it the best toner out there? I can’t say. But it does a good job for the price. Really nice toner, I have dry cheeks and oily t zone and chin. Lots of hormonal acne on my chin and jaw. This helps to reduce irritation. On my second bottle. Good value for price point I’ve really enjoyed this toner. I LOVE aqua bomb and had to dive into some more belif products. This toner is really helping my hormonal acne flair ups. I’m also really enjoying the smell. Been using this product and so far haven't broke out! Gentle enough for me. I really like this ! Does not burn my face or any open pimples . And keeps my face clear !!! Really enjoying so far it works good, the fragrance is very clean and fresh. I think this toner is just for normal use, it can not heal the acne. WOW! So recently, since summer started, I’ve gotten really bad acne. My face was just covered in big pimples and redness, then I came across this acne started kit at sephora which included this tiny version clearing wash. Within a week I already saw inprovement!

I would wash and follow with my regular skincare routine but I would end up looking so greasy the next morning when I wake up or throughout the whole day.

It does not irritate and performs well! Love this product, but the bottle needs a redsigns. Out of 6 bottles I've purchased, 4 leak when pumed from under the silver pump screw cap. And it's really messy to take back. Requires an extra thread in my opinion. I have very acne-prone skin. After starting to use a Retin-A for my acne, my face dried out like crazy, and makeup remover wipes only exacerbated the problem. This cleansing oil has totally saved me. It removes almost ALL of my makeup while keeping my skin hydrated. And it doesn't break me out! The only problem I've been having is that I have a hard time removing all of my mascara with this. However, I've been too pleased with the overall effect of this product to get too fussed about that small detail.\n",

I sampled it along with a couple other products (too faced melt off and boscia make up break up) before ultimately deciding on this product. Although it seems like a big investment due to the price, it’s totally worth it since I am using less makeup removing wipes now which were very irritating for my skin. Per the directions, I only use a few tiny pumps of product each use and that’s enough to get the job done. Leaves skin makeup free and feeling super soft.\n",

They are great for traveling. We got stuck in the airport overnight, my face wash was in my checked back, at our destination. Having these in my carryon was so nice. I like having a scrubbier side and a smooth side. Gives you the option of how much if any exfoliating you want. Being individually wrapped keeps them sanitary and convenient. I use one or two a week for exfoliating when traveling. When you travel a lot,these take up such a tiny amount of space and I don’t have to have it in the liquid bag.\n",

I find this very gentle and a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time. I've tried quite a few eye makeup removers, and I keep going back to this one! The oily removers leave a residue for me, and the ones labeled \"oil-free\" don't seem to work as well. This guy gets my makeup off and comes off clean. It takes off my eye shadow, primer, and waterproof mascara. It does take 2-3 passes to get it all off, but that's standard with every eye makeup remover I've ever used. Oh and the price point is excellent! This bottle lasts me 6-8 months.\n",

But because my acne is hormonal I think it’s a little tougher to clear up. Has a nice lather and leaves my skin feeling clean A nice, light, clarifying product. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling dried out, and seems to help keep imperfections at bay. I use this soap bar for my body in the shower, as I do get acne breakouts on my chest and back from time to time. It does seem to keep them at bay, and my skin feels very clean after I use it. (I will say it gives that tight, squeaky feeling, though, so I wouldn't recommend using it on your face if you have dry skin. Half star off for that.) While it's a good bargain at $12, I really wish it lasted longer. I find myself having to buy a bar more often than I'd like, so another half star off for that. If you use it in the shower like I do, I recommend keeping it inside a container so that it keeps a little longer.\n",

I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my skin but overall my face is different. Totally worth the $12 and is a good product. My face feels so good after using this product. Love this product, not loving the nearly ten dollar price increase at sephora. However, this tube lasts me nearly a year so a little goes a long way and dramatically reduces that cost in comparison to drugs store products. I use this in the mornings and so far I love it. I can feel it working on my pores and have seen a visible reduction in pore size. My face purged when I started using this and fabs retinol serum at night but now my face is clearing up again. I will continue to purchase. I use this as well as the Retinol Serum from the brand - one night a week each. I definitely like this stuff more than the Retinol, I just find it a little thin. But it rubs in quite nicely, and the odour isn’t too strong. My acne is going down steadily and I trust the product and the brand enough to continue to use it because I know I’ll continue to see results. I took off a star because it is really drying, but my skin is getting used to it, and I am using Retinol as well. As long as you’re moisturizing sufficiently, you shouldn’t have too much of an issue with this product. I like using GlamGlow Thirsty Mud the night after I use each of these really drying products. I know that once my skin is used to it, it’ll be happy and healthy and acne free.\n",

This is a good cleanser but I don’t feel like you get enough product for the price. Plus it’s *just* a good cleanser. There’s not a whole lot magical about it besides it being nice for sensitive skin. If it either was a little cheaper or came in a bigger bottle I’d repurchase If you love their rose line-up, you'll likely love this cleanser too. Sometimes we have days where we are lazy with our skincare (no, just me then?) and to have something that's super easy and where the smell is something to look forward to... is nice. It's a total luxury and non-necessity, and the amount you get for the price seems a little much, but I don't regret buying it! My face feels soft and clean after using it. I have combination skin but my T-zone is incredibly oily and I would say that I feel this does a good job of balancing the skin. Will this cleanser solve all of your skin problems? I'm not sure, but the process of finding out is going to smell and feel delightful. :)\n",

First off, I think some of these reviews are actually talking about the Saturn mask. This doesn't even have sulfur in it. It smells kinda fresh and a bit herbal to me. Now, I don't feel like it necessarily does anything for my acne other than leave it the heck alone. I get hormonal, often cystic acne flare ups once a month around my mouth and/or jaw line, and this is much nicer at not irritating my skin any further in these areas. I also manage mild to moderate rosacea on my face and eyes. This is where I love this product. It has a lovely cooling effect on my cheeks, which often feel warm during a flare up, and doesn't irritate my skin like the drugstore toners tended to. My sister saw me for the first time since I started using this recently and remarked that my face doesn't look as red as it usually does, so perhaps it is helping with the redness as well!

It works super well as a moisturizer and has a nice light rose smell to it. As a cleansing balm, it removes the majority of my make up but not all of it. I usually use a make up wipe or micellular water to remove the little bit of make up that still lingers. I have super sensitive skin but this product never irritates it which is nice.

It smells like fruit loops.. in the best way. Sooo good! I didn’t see much of a difference/change in my skin but it did leave it feeling fresh and clean each time! I love this product. My skin is very sensitive to just about everything. But this product has been amazing. I use it every time before applying moisturizer and I find I feel better moisturized. Especially in winter, my cheeks tend to get quite dry even with moisturizer but with this lotion combined with my usual moisturizer I feel much better relief from dry skin. So far, this is my favourite toner until I find another one. Feels refreshing and the scent is quite light. I didn't get a breakout after using this. I've been using this for years. I have sensitive skin and sometimes eczema. it doesn't irritate the eye at all, and remove the eye make up well. it is effective, but for the price tag i advise you to choose clinique or something equivalent instead -- clarins feels great, but we could better use it for ritual-like self-care I just keep coming back for this product, it remover my eye makeup are so quick, and gently I have no real complaints about this product, I’m just not sure how much it’s benefiting my skin. It applies nicely and I like that it’s a toner and an essence in one. To me, the more efficient you can make a skin routine the better. So if anyone comes out with an Essence, toner, retinol, and vitamin C, moisturizer, and sunscreen in one I’ll be the first in line to try it! ;) So while I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my skin appearance, I haven’t broken out or had any unusual reactions and it saves me a step so I’ll probably keep using it.

The only problem I have is with the packaging. It is designed to keep the product from flowing freely. Therefor, you have to shake the bottle to get the product out. This is a serious design flaw since most are usually trying to get the product onto a cotton ball or cotton pad. A lot of product gets needlessly wasted because of this.

It is light and refreshing. I feel it balances my skin and preps it for serums. I definitely notice IMMEDIATELY when I stop using it, my combo skin breaks out within days. I now buy two at a time! It’s a little drying, I think due to the witch hazel, which wasn’t expected. I will use it up but probably not repurchase as I use Retin-a and don’t like the added dryness after I use it. I like this cleanser a lot - rinses clean, exfoliates well. Unfortunately the smell is really off-putting. I don't shop for cleansers based on scent, but this one is so unpleasant it takes away from the experience. I love First Aid Beauty products, and this one is no exception. It's not harsh when it comes to the scrub and leaves my skin incredibly smooth after use. I didn't give it 5 stars though because of the scent. It is quite overwhelming . almost smells like campfire. Seems like from the reviews it's hit or miss if you can smell it though. This is a nice and gentle physical exfoliator that does just enough but not too much. I'm sensitive and prone to irritation and this one gives me no issues. There's no extra unnecessary ingredients and it's fragrance free. This would be a great exfoliator to keep around and great for someone starting out looking to add something gentle to their skincare regimen. I really like this cleanser, it’s not super rough on the skin and I love exfoliating cleansers! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the scent is kind of weird. I wish it had no scent like the ultra repair cream or even a floral scent would be nice! not the best toner I used, I got this for my acne. didn't get to finish using it. it is pretty dry for my face. I think it's ok to use it during summertime but in winter its too dry for me. that's I give 4 stars, other than dry for wintertime, other things are fine. It’s gentle and doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped. Wouldn’t mind a little more hydration. Nice hydrating toner. No alcohol sting after exfoliating. Minus one star for the weird smell, or lack thereof?? Very refreshing! The herbal smell makes me feel like i just left the spa and my face feels even cleaner after a wash. I also love that it doesn’t sting and helps balance out the oiliness on my face. great soothing toner that doesn’t irritate my skin! just wish it didn’t have dye in it This is a fairly gentle exfoliant. Nothing super special about it in my opinion, but it does what it advertises. Takes off waterproof mascara in a pinch and the cap on the bottle is sturdy enough that I do not have to worry about it opening and leaking in my overnight bag. Price is steep, but this does not pull out my eyelashes and leave product residue like the Garnier blue bottle I was using Works okay, not sure if I want to repurchase it. Sensitive skin friendly, but ran out too quickly. I love this product it really clean my face and it feels good after. Love this toner and love the fact that I don’t need cotton swabs! I really like toners but can never seem to keep track of my cotton swabs so this toner appealed to me. Milk has been a decently consistent brand for me and this toner has done nothing but good for my skin. Less pimples and healthier skin! So much better than I expected! I’ve been using this for a couple of months now. My skin is generally pretty sensitive to new products, but this has been so great with my skin. Minimized my pores and toned down redness, not to mention it feels so nice and cool on skin. I do love how this product does not dry out the skin and doesn't have that alcohol feel to it. I use it morning and night and pat it down on my face before applying my moisturizer. I have seen a difference in my skin, mostly when I wake up. I just don't love the perfume smell, it's a little too strong and I feel like I'm putting on a fragrance on my face. I would've loved it without that added fragrance. My skin has been definitely started to look better since using this–along with a few other products I’ve added to my skin care routine. Only complaint is that it does leave me with a filmy-sticky type feeling even after it has dried but it does go away once I’ve applied my moisturizer. I have been using this toner for a month, and so far I'm happy with it. It's very refreshing, and skill feels clean after it. One star off for the alcohol but other than that this toner is great for my oily skin. I've been using this for a few weeks now and I could not feel the alcohol AT ALL. I even went back to the ingredient list to see if they reformulated it since I last read it a few months ago when I first considered it. I really recommend this, it feels so hydrating and like real recovery for the skin. Great toner. It helps to reduce the redness of my skin and minimize the oil. My skin feels clean immediately after applying it. And I love that it's a clean product. This is the first toner that doesn’t break me out, and it’s actually made my skin way less oily and dry. I’m not too crazy about the smell, but it works amazingly well! This is comparable to TATCHA Rice Enzyme Powder that I've loved for years. This Clinique one does the job and leaves the skin soft. I like how this is separated into small packets instead of being in a big jar like the Tatcha. However, price wise, it's actually very expensive. When I bought this, I thought I'm saving money over the Tatcha powder. But instead, counting the $ per gram, you pay more for this one. This one turns out to be $2.10 per gram while the Tatcha one is $1.08.\n",
      "…read more I used this product once a day for the entire 28 days, and I did notice a nice change in my skin. It was nothing drastic by any means; however, it did help to fade some of my dark spots from acne scarring. I would recommend this to anyone that has mild dark spots...I bet it would clear those right up. I love this micellar water more than I thought that I would... I love they way it makes my skin feel after cleansing! I feel that this has made such a difference in the texture and the complexion of my skin after just 2 weeks of using. DOUBLE CLEANSING is a must for me so I am hooked!! The only downside is that I am unable to use on my eyes :( This micellar cleansing water is pretty good. I like to use it in the mornings because it's quick, gentle, and efficient. It is great for dry and sensitive skin though I think it's suitable for all skin types. Even though it's pretty good, I won't be repurchasing because I don't think it's much different than any other micellar water that I can get for less money. Good micellar water, nothing special. It does smell really nice, really clean and like lavender. It does leave my face feeling ever so slightly sticky afterwards. Leaves my face feeling refreshed and moist. Does not dry out my skin and smells great too! I have to start with the scent, it's so delicious with rose and sweet combination that triggers my childhood memory and makes me feel refreshed. It also hydrates my (dry/ normal) skin and calming it after sun exposure. I love it in general for summer but I don't think I'll use it for fall and winter. I like this product. I wear quite light makeup. My makeup routine is always like this primer, cushion foundation, blush, a little bit of conturing powder for my nose, eyebrow powder. I wear lash extensions so I don’t really wear eye makeup. This micellar water takes all my makeup off by using 2 cotton pads. There is no need to really soak the pads for me but gotta get them wet enough. I try to take off eye makeup sometime but it takes more to remove all the colors and waterproof eyeliner. Also, I can see my skin is improving. At first, I was afraid that only using this without washing my face with face wash would break me out. Oh boy! I was wrong. This little friend is amazing for those who would get lazy at night after a long day like me. It can take off everything without rinsing. After I use this, I apply toner with cotton pad and there is no residue on the pad. It’s really cool. It’s on a pricier side for a makeup remover without rinsing so I just take one star off.\n",
      "…read more This is the perfect take your makeup off water cleanser. At first I was skeptical about it I have previously used the Gariner micellar water cleanser and it didn’t do much for me and felt like I still had to rinse again just to get the remainder of my makeup off. But I went ahead and took a chance with La Mer and so glad I did I purchased the smaller size first which is $50 and I am loving it a little goes a long way and I no longer need to over rinse my face just to take off my makeup this doesn’t it all for me. The small bottle lasted me about 4 months and will definitely be repurchasing to the larger size. Pricey but worth it.\n",
      "…read more I wanted to love this product to the fullest because everything about it is great except it irritates my eyes every time. I’ve been using it for a few months as part of a double cleanse at night. The texture is great and washes off easily. Removed mascara and heavy makeup very well. There’s a very mild scent which I didn’t mind at all. Unfortunately I will not be re purchasing because of the eye irritation. I love this product so far. I want to see how well it works after 30 days. This is another product I keep going back to. As I'm getting older, I noticed I need to use a lot more product, but I like that it not only hydrates and tightens my skin some, it also acts like a primer and hides imperfections as well. Been using this for about a month and have been pleased with the results thus far. Instantly slightly plumps fine lines and I've seen a noticeable difference in my skin both in firmness and clarity since using. I use two pumps every morning, but would probably see more benefits if I used twice daily. Fast absorbing, nice smell, and very lightweight! I have combination skin that's very prone to breakouts. Any change in skincare typically results in a 3 week purge. I've been using it for about a month and this product didn't make me break out at all! That's a major plus. It also hasn't made my skin feel dehydrated like other retinol products have and my skin looks clearer, brighter, and my fine lines are less noticeable. These are all the positives. The one negative is that I can only use the product once per week (even thought I've been using other retinol products in the past). It does cause quite a bit of flaking which shows up two or three days after application. That being said, I anticipate the flaking to stop the longer I use it. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive or break out-prone skin.\n",

I will continue to buy this product This is the first retinol I have found that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I haven’t noticed a big difference in my fine lines, but I have noticed a huge improvement in the oiliness of my chin. I am not lying really it helpful sephora employed recommend me that it good for dray skin and for acne control so far it did work i used in the night time... Pros: texture wise, beautifully sat on my face. Very smooth, soft and hydrated. Worked well around the eye areas as well. Cons: It balled up when I applied my sunscreen and foundation on top. I did wait for 10 minutes before applying my sunscreen though... Also it hasn’t lightened my freckles as suggested by the Sephora beauty advisor. Verdict: It’ll work beautifully as an evening product. Unfortunately, I’m mainly looking for a product for daytime use that doesn’t ball up and can lighten my recent developed freckles. Will definitely recommend this product for evening use.\n",
      "…read more I am not totally convinced about the magic of algae, but as far as hyaluronic acid serums go this one really does work for me. My skins looks great when I use it, well enough that I’ve bought the full size a couple of times now. So I was looking for the fine lines that were starting around my eyes and mouth. I had some hyperpigmentation that lightened up and the small lines don’t exist. I’m at in my early 30s, but it’s nothing like early prevention. So I initially got this as a 100 point reward from Sephora, and OH MY GOD, I was HOOKED!! So I went back & got three more of the 100-point sizes. When I ran out of those, I bought the full size. And I know this sounds weird, but I don’t feel like the results from the full size we’re as great? Note: I was initially really put off by the recent, but I ended up really liking the scent after awhile. I received a 10 day sample of this product and noticed it gave my Skii Essence and Lancome Visionnaire Serum a remarkable boost within a week of use. I have super sensitive skin and it has never made me break out. I am on my third bottle now and I love the extra hydration that this product gives my skin, which can be a difficult balance living in a state like Texas. I love the smell and the way this product absorbs into my skin. It does well under Too Faced Primed & Poreless Primer with BareMinerals makeup on top. Overall I have noticed my skin appears smoother and more “plump” since I have added it to my morning beauty regimen.\n",

I've been searching high and low for a moisturizer that can combat the dry, flaky skin I've developed over the last few years, trying upwards of 20 different brands, formulations, ingredients, etc. and THIS one actually works. After 2 months of use my skin is hydrated, has a more even tone, is firmer, and overall looks better than it has in years. The major downside is the price... $70 for 1oz of product is ridiculous. I am repurchasing, but will continue my hunt for something comparable at a better value.\n",

I received a jar of this to review. I was super excited to try this moisturizer provided to me from influenster. This is a Great moisturizer. It is a little too heavy for me to use in the summer. It is a great winter moisturizer. I wasn’t crazy about how it felt after I put it on. It was a little thicker than I liked. I used it before bedtime and that worked well for me. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks. I enjoy the smell of it , and now that the cold weather is here , my skin gets more dry. I have noticed it is helping me with keeping it moisturized. I don’t know if I’ve noticed a huge difference in my skin, but I still like it , because it doesn’t go on too thick and I don’t feel my skin getting dry throughout the day. I did receive this product free for testing purposes , but I will buy it in the future.\n",
      "…read more I received this from Influenster to try for free. This would be a splurge item for me, after using it I would definitely think about doing just that. I liked how moisturized my face seems while using it. When my skin is dry it starts to look like I have larger pores. I don't, but to me that is the appearance. This keeps my skin plump and soft looking. I received a complementary sample of this product and courtesy of Influenster and Vox Box. I am usually cautious when purchasing moisturizers because of sensitive skin. Skin care products can be expensive, and it is trial and error to find something that works well for my skin. I really wanted to test the product out, and give it an extensive trail being that I received it as a promotional sample. my skin has dry patches and it’s very hard for me to find products that work and not cause a reaction. This product actually does well. I didn’t break out after using it. I used the product over a few weeks. My skin felt smooth and moisturized. I didn’t notice much improvement over my fine lines, however I did show some brightening and my complexion. The products did you sing a bit at various times, which is why I took off the star. That could’ve been because of my sensitive skin. I can see myself using this product in the winter mostly wear my skin is more dehydrated. It never left my skin greasy. I would consider purchasing this after I run out.\n",

I am an oily skin with concerns of aging. This product is a gel cream texture and in the summer when I first tried it, it was a bit heavy for my oily skin liking. Now that the weather is turning colder I do find that I like it a lot better. If you are dry you will love this product as it’s still pretty moisturizing despite the gel texture. I found that after a while of using it, my skin was plumper and firmer. I also find this product is great as a primer!! Hold my foundation beautifully! Would recommend this to all skin types!\n",
      "…read more This is a great moisturizer for dry skin. I have combination skin so I found it to be too much for me. It doesn’t feel heavy when applied and soaks right into the skin. I would recommend this for people with drier skin. (I received this product for free so I could review it.) I love this product- it really does work at slowly getting rid of old acne scars. HOWEVER, I’ve noticed I’ve been getting new acne right next to the old scar that I’ve been putting the serum on. I don’t think it’s a coincidence since this has happened 3 times now. I have fairly sensitive skin, so if you don’t have sensitive skin then I would definitely recommend this product. If you’re prone to acne like me and have super sensitive skin, be warned.\n",

I took off one star because I don't think the effect is extreme enough to justify the high price, but it definitely helps what I was looking to address on my skin!! I will likely buy it again when I have a coupon. Echoing other reviewers regarding the potency of this formula. I have never had a negative reaction to retinol, but burned my skin within three days of adding this one to my regimen. I am backing off to 1-2 nights per week and anticipate getting great results. I do think the packaging could make the risks a bit more clear, though, as could Sephora associates when recommending this product. This is the first retinol product I’ve used consistently and love it. I’m on my second bottle. Definitely noticed a difference and to me, it’s worth the price. It has helped with my dark spots and I’ve been very careful to use sunscreen while using the product. My skin can be sensitive and I had no reaction to this. My main skin concerns are dark spots, dullness and fine lines and this serum is transforming my skin. I've only been using this nightly for 2-3 weeks and already noticing my stubborn melasma fading and my complexion is coming back to life. I haven't experienced the dryness and irritation others reported. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the scent is very off-putting (there's a hint of citrus but I can only describe it as lemon yogurt) and I sort of have to brace myself before applying it.\n",
      "…read more Great serum and very light I received a 0.5 fl oz sample which lasted about 3 weeks. TEXTURE: lightweight but nourishing, sinks into skin quickly, non-greasy, leaves smooth finish, suitable for all skin types! INGREDIENTS: LONG list including a lot of plant extracts, score of 3 from EWG (moderate hazard). Love the smell and texture of the product.. has an overall nice and hydrating feel to it. Not too heavy for oily skin. However, don’t think I’ll repurchase again. Didn’t really deliver what it promises. Love the serum! Only complaint is I wish it came in a bigger bottle This product did plump fine lines, it didn’t diminish them but I did notice an improvement, I’m 40 and have filler in a few spots on my lower face to combat collagen loss and skin laxity and I will say the product drew water to the filler making it more plump in those areas with filler, it is cosmetically elegant, feels nice during application and has a gel like consistency, 4 stars because of the fragrance it’s very perfumey, get rid of the fragrance it does nothing for the skin it’s actually an irritant and degrades the actives in products. The price tag at $122 Canadian is quite steep imo.\n",

Doesn't totally clear out my skin, but this has become part of my daily regimen. I'm in my late 20s and suffered from really bad hormonal acne and cystic acne for about 5 years, all along my jawline, chin and cheeks. I use this (and Dermadoctor's \"ain't misbehavin\" cleanser) and it's been the only thing that's worked. I use this stuff twice daily under my moisturizer and it is AMAZING. Cleared up my acne completely in under a month and kept in controlled. Now my once-monthly flare ups are just a pimple or two. (Huuuuge improvement to what it was). I dont think it does much for my wrinkles, but that's not why I purchased it.\n",

I use it under my sunscreen and it’s perfect for those cold and dry winter m months. So far so good. I've used it for a few weeks, my skin looks with less pigmentation and looks glowy in the morning. I really like the light scent of this product. I pat it on on top of my night serum/cream/eye routine. My face feels slightly oily when I go to bed, but when I wake up, it’s perfectly moisturized and ready to be washed and tackle my day routine. I’ve been using this for the last month and I have not suffered any dry winter skin at all. It’s a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way, and I love a gentle retinol product! This is a good addition to your nighttime ritual if you’re serious about fighting signs of aging. I loved this! My skin felt amazing just after a few applications. I’ve only recently stared using this product it seems to work well.. I haven’t fully seen any long lasting results just yet but I do feel that I need to be consistent on using it for. A longer period of time so see some good results so I’m going to keep using it.. I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes.. I did not expect much from this product at first, as I do not have any dark circles, but I am here to tell you it does soo much more than brighten eyes! I started using it and after about 2 weeks I noticed a big difference in the skin around my eyes it had really smoothed the skin and it did not feel crepe-y!

Hope this helps! The 1st time I try Estée Lauder products and I like this one. I love the smell and the smooth feeling of my face after I apply it. Not sure if it really minimizes my pores since I’m using cleansers, masks, toners, creams, serums of different brands at the same time. But still love it, my skin is better anyway I loved this as my primer. Should've used it after my face wash before moisturizer before bed. That was when I noticed an actual difference with my skin. I love Algenist products and this is one of the reasons why!! This smells fantastic, it’s actually the only product that my boyfriend has ever commented on (he lives the scent too). I’m not much of an oil person because it makes me look super shiny and most of them seem to cause me to break out. This locks in moisture like an oil but doesn’t make me look or feel greasy and hasn’t caused any breakouts. My skin feels soft the next day even if I can’t attribute any visible results to the product. It is pricey but it lasts a very long time. Still, I prefer to buy it during the vip sale!!\n",

I love the fact that I can mix it with anything (moisturizer, sunscreen, etc.) but the reason for 4 stars is it can be messy dealing with the powder and the small spoon. This works great added to any face oil to add vitamin C to your skin care regimen. This is a great product and blends easily with most of my moisturizers. I have an oily t-zone and my AM routine consists of oil-free/matte finish products. I only gave this item a 4 out of 5 because I can not utilize it on long days where I want to be shine free. When using this product, I tend to get shiny after 4-6 hours of wear; so I steer clear from this product on event days (weddings, etc.). Other than that, its great for daily use and it does have a slight tingling/brightening effect.\n",

Use to be one of my holy grails. I used it almost everyday for almost two years! Back then, my skin was better than it is now so maybe the serum had something to do with it. As of now, I only don’t repurchase because I cannot afford it anymore. I do miss it tho! This product is amazing. I had the perk facial and the technician recommended it. I used it every night for 30 days. My skin was clear and smooth, always fresh! As for wrinkles I couldn’t tell you if this really reduces wrinkles or any product for that matter, but with this my skin was always clean feeling, bright and smooth. This is the best acne treatment product I have used! Sulfur and tea tree products dry my skin out and take at least a week for the pimple to go down! These stay on throughout the night and prevents me from picking more, and I only have to use it once or twice for it to disappear! However, the do leave a ring around the area so make sure you wash your face throughly before applying makeup, I made the mistake and later saw the mark. I’ve been jealous seeing other people’s results from cheaper products like corsx but this is worth the price because it’s actually worked for me and pulled all the gunk out!\n",

For over 2 years I had small bumps/texture on my forehead and it went away a few days after I started using this and it hasn't come back. My skin still isn't perfect but I definitely notice a huge difference. Would definitely reccomend if you struggle with skin texture! I’ve been using this nightly for about six months now and follow up with a face lotion. A friend raves about it and I was wanting to switch up my face care regiment so I gave it a try. The oil is light and it dries quickly so that’s a plus. When I wake up my face always feels silky soft but other than that I can’t tell any difference. For the cost, I wouldn’t say it’s worth it.

Couldn’t these be put into a recyclable jar, instead of the packets? Or better yet, offer this product in a bottle, so you can use your own biodegradable or reusable cotton rounds.

I decided to add this back into my routine. Within two weeks of using it again, my skin was starting to glow again. Not only was my skin getting it’s glow back, but my skin was looking plump again too. Plumping up any tiny fine lines that had started to appear. The texture of my skin was also starting to improve. I don’t know what I was thinking discontinuing this stuff. It’s amazing. My favorite thing about it, is how your skin feels the second you apply it. As it states it’s like an instant rush of hydration... Quenching any thirst your skin may be lacking with it’s fast-absorbing formula. Also, doing a great job soaking in your products, to get the most effectiveness out of your serums and creams to follow. I do doc one star, while the ingredients are great, the balance between the most valuable ingredients in it, to me, and the concentration of those ingredients, become diluted down in the formula so it can be made toner or an essence, making this a little over priced, value to dollar. BUT, there is nothing quite like it or it’s formula (or even how it’s “Miracle Broth” is made) sooo it’s still a winner in my book. Also: For those who are really concerned about what they put on their skin, this is formulated without Parabens, Phthalates or Sulfates!\n",

This also helps boost the decolletage area if you're getting any sleep lines. I was referred this product by a friend. I use this with my Powerful Strength Line reducing concentrate DAY and NIGHT. Let me start by saying that I have oily/combination skin. Since I’ve upgraded my skincare regimen I now have normal/combination. I have severe hyperpigmentation from my teens and its worst around my chin and neck. This product have changed my life. The hyperpigmentation on my chin and neck have faded significantly over the past few months. Please keep in mind this hyperpigmentation was extremely darker that my skin tone. Although it is visibly there, I see a major difference in fading. You have to use this product DAY and NIGHT for this to work with SPF (SPF 40 or higher). Well thats for any product that is correcting dark spots. Not only has this helped fade my dark spots but my face has gotten so much smoother as well! I will be keeping this as a staple in my regimen.\n",

I was looking for anything that would help and this was the only product I purchased that made a visible difference! After 3 months of use the spots had faded significantly. I stopped using the solution at that point but decided to re-up this year when another bad breakout caused another round of really dark spots. I've only been using the solution again for about 2 months now and the difference is incredible. My spots are on their way to being gone completely. I recommend using this product after cleansing with Dr. Bronner's Pure Castile Soap in Peppermint and toning with Olehenriksen Glow2OH Dark Spot Toner for the perfect dark spot removal routine.

I’m very impressed with the results from the dark shot solution. I started to see a change in my dark marks solution within two to three weeks. I use the product two times per day. I can’t wait to see more results within the next month. I’ve tried using this product many ways. The only way that I like to use it is with an spf. I really do like this for the no makeup days. I mix it with my supergoop spf and it works wonders. Only downfall is that it does tend to transfer - so it can get on clothing and on hands if you rub the area you applied. Also, a little goes a long way! If you use too much, you will look orange. If you are wanting something with more coverage, this is not it! It’s very sheer and will only add a nice bronze. I had previously bought the tanning drops by isle of paradise, but I found it always clogged my pores and would give me mini break outs. So I figured I’d try a company that seems to center itself around clean ingredients! I don’t know if I was just missing something, but I figured this was the same type of deal as isle or paradise where you apply it then night before and let it develop.. eventually I realize no, you add it each morning and it’s a one day wear type of thing. It definitely gives a nice glow and really evens out my skin tone! I wear concealer on top and everything looks put together which is nice! It also hasn’t broken me out at all which I love! Just make sure you use lotion (nothing fancy. Cerave from Walmart works great) and mix and rub in well! Give it a second to settle because initially it looks a little orange but after a few seconds it evens itself out great.\n",

I think it makes my skin look a little glowy, as well, since it has a bit of a shimmer (not glitter). Not sure how to tell if the anti-pollution bit is working but I’ve seen no negative effects so I’m gonna say it’s doing its job!\n",

It hasn't done anything fabulous to my face but neither has it worsened my condition. Good thing is that it is very easy to use and won't cause a mess, I would like to carry it around with me especially during travelling. But again, I haven't seen a significant improvement in my skin. I’ve been using this product for almost two years now? And while I do think its anti aging claims are legitimate, I wish it wasn’t so expensive :’( I like the product dispenser that comes with it- it puts out just the right amount needed for your face/neck. The product itself is pretty watery but once applied, it becomes tacky and gradually sinks into your skin. I found that this product also helps with keeping my skin moisturized (in addition to my moisturizer), and it goes great under makeup as well.\n",

I mostly shower at night, so I use these pads in the morning to get my daily skincare routine started. So far so good. Face can be a little sticky after use. My advice to anyone is to have realistic expectations and to make sure glycolic acid doesn’t make you break out. I really like these. They really brighten and soften my skin. I keep seeing a trend with the negative reviews, where most people seeing insignificant results all have acne as a concern. I feel like acne scarring will be helped with products like this but to a certain degree. I happen to not suffer from acne and just have average texture so for me these work great. My skin looks brighter, feels softer and I think these are a great replacement for my Good Genes that I can’t in good conscious buy anymore.\n",
      "…read more These are pretty nice. But do not follow the package recommendation to use it once or twice a day. Against my better judgement I tried this and got some hyperpigmentation for a few days. But overall does a great job. These pads are great for gentle exfoliating of the skin. The smell is not too strong and doesn’t stay on the skin. Leaves the skin feeling smooth and silky and absorbs fairly quickly. The pads are sturdy and don’t tear easily which is good. And after you take the pad out and exfoliate once you can wait until the skin is dry and exfoliate again as the pad doesn’t dry very quickly so you could get 2-3 good exfoliations of the face from one pad in one go. I am still iffy about the price point, but it’s a toner and exfoliator in one so I’m happy about that. Good for summer and winter times and any skin type.\n",

I’ve never used a lotion like this before. It’s completely watery! Very interesting! The smell is unique as well. I like it! I used this as a toner and it worked well. Not a fan of The smell but not a big deal. I have been struggling with acne rosacea since April 2019. After a huge flare up in December nothing seemed to work. I got this yesterday and applied my bumps went down this morning when I looked in the mirror I gave 4 stars because I haven’t used it very long yet but fingers crossed this is it!!! In my first trimester and looking for a product to replace my retinoids. Product doesn't make me break out and goes on smoothly but still waiting to see if it works as well as retinoids - I haven't noticed a change and it's been 2 weeks. I use this on days when I plan to run around doing chores and errands. I get compliments from strangers that I am \"glowing\". I noticed that effect is not as strong several days in a row. I have oily skin so this serum under my makeup is too much - too moisturizing. So, I basically use this with a heavy eye cream on days I can't be bothered with foundation. No breakouts, very moisturizing. I would definitely recommend!\n",

I don't do well with Retinol (dries me out), but I like this alternative. I wish the ingredients were cleaner (why have artificial coloring??), but I'm happy with it for now. here's my deal. I'm 34 with LONG history of cystic acne. my skin is oily t zone, central american skin with hereditary HUGE pores. been on antibiotics, accutane, and now on spironolactone. my skin is clear for the most part except for monthly pop ups. I started using this serum last year when I was on NO acne meds. Then it made me break out. I stopped using it , my skin cleared only a little and then I resumed using it. Then I broke out again and I stopped using it but my break outs didn't stop. I was put on spironolactone and now that I'm clear I have resumed using it. It does work, but maybe not for hormonal cystic acne ppl like me. This silky, non oily serum is quickly absorbed into your skin. you wake up with soft, plump skin and over time your acne scars and pores s apppear softer and faded. Your look and texture of skin seem more filtered. I recommend it only if you have your acne under control. Good luck.\n",

I would give this 5 stars but it’s just so expensive! And small bottle- I wish a larger size was available! Doesn’t make me break out and absorbs quickly. I love this serum and have really enjoyed including it in my routine. It’s very moisturizing and I actually feel like it has improved my skin! I also love the scent. The only reason I am deducting a star is for the pump on the bottle. It stopped dispensing early on after I purchased so I have to unscrew the top to get it out (I tweeted at the company and they said that they have heard this feedback before). For someone who is looking for a gentle alternative to retinol, this is a really really great choice!\n",

The pump is not able to reach the product once you are about half way through the bottle (I'm on my third bottle and this has happened every time). I have to dig cotton swabs around in the bottle to try to use all the product and there is always way more product than I would like left in the bottle when I finally give up and buy a new one. Other than the packaging, I think this is a great retinol alternative. No irritation and you can use in conjunction with other products you can't use with real retinols.\n",

I have been using it for 1 week and I am already seeing dark spots go away. Lovvvve this stuff! I have dry/acne prone skin and this leave my skin treated for acne without over dying it. Most times dry skin can leave you breaking out more due to dehydration, but this product eliminates that problem ! I've used it for about 2 weeks at this point and it's WORKING. My acne / blemish prone skin has been suffering for over a year and I haven't been able to get it under control. I'd go through a string of products and wake up the next morning with congested skin and black/white heads. It was NEVER ENDING. This oil does the job and cleared up my complexion within the first week of using it. Definitely a must buy. The only downfall is the smell. Kinda smells like pencil shavings from middle school when you open the pencil sharpener.\n",
      "…read more I love this serum. I got it specifically because I have huge pores on my t-zone, and I’m gonna be totally honest it doesn’t do much for my pores. However, it did smooth out my uneven skin and make it look a LOT better. All in all, very happy with this and how it feels and how it makes me look but wish it had done more for pores!! Not a miracle worker, but does minimize pores with continued use. Need to pair with moisturizer if you have dry skin. This is probably the best primer I’ve used so far and I’ve used quite a few! It does help makeup last longer and it does blur the look of large pores. I took one star off because it is expensive . I did feel it was worth it and I will buy again. This is my first Farsali product and i honestly love it!!! Makes my skin feel amazing and soft. Blurs fine lines and pores so well!! I have no real problem with this. Tip of advise if you don’t know how to use this. Apply this over your moisturizer if not wearing makeup because this product can be very drying if applied to bare skin. Which is why it works for me due to my oily skin. If using makeup, apply over a hydrating primer and blend it out before applying foundation. The only issues I had were: the dropper getting clogged & making my foundation look bulky/cakey/dry. However, if you want a matte face after moisturizer, this is great.\n",

I didn’t see quick results with this product on a big ol zit I had. Worked on smaller ones. I am prone to cystic acne and have struggle with acne only since turning 30 (I am now 36). Nothing over the counter helps when my whole face is flaring up, only prescriptions. HOWEVER this product keeps my acne in check afterwards. It is one of the only spot treatments that actually works for me. It even works on small cysts (albeit slowly.) It can be a little harsh with other strong products so I try to avoid putting anything else near pimples I am treating with this product, except light moisturizers which I apply under this treatment.\n",

For me when I put it on a newly formed pimple it pretty much goes away, but if I put it on a pimple that I have had for a day or two it takes much longer for it to go away. It’s pretty darn slow. I wish it was some what faster as I don’t like applying a drying spot treatment to be applied every single day till the bump is no more to be felt or seen. It didn’t irritate my skin though considering my very sensitive combo dry skin. Works like a gem but has a smell. I honestly do think this product works. I have really sensitive skin and live in a dry area and this works well even with all the other products I use for my face. BUT! The smell is pretty unbearable for me. Because it uses sulphur I feel like it gets on my pillow and makes my pillow a tad stinky. Works great but do think of the smell that make rub off. Loved the product! Works great and it does redice lines on my forehead! BUT!!!!!! A 0.33 oz bottle is only 25 dollars! 3 small bottles is 1 oz = 75 dollars, where the big 1 oz bottle is 89.... dont know why they price it like this... I have very dry skin and most primers dry out my skin even more and make my foundation look cakey. This is a great primer for dry skin. Gives you a gorgeous glow. I also sometimes apply it over my cheekbones on top of foundation. One thing, if I apply my foundation with a brush or rub it in too much, it can become flakey so use a light hand and a beauty blender to press down the foundation instead of move it around.\n",

So much comes off onto this thing it's like a miracle. Only giving four starts because they don't give much for the price. I just my strip up to fit small sections so I don't waste any I have used 3 bottles of this. At first I had really bad skin discoloration and this helped a lot with it. However, after a couple of bottles I think my skin got used it, and stopped responding as well to it.

The first couple of weeks, the oil smelled like kale and black cumin oil. (Note: Black cumin oil can smell like pencil shavings when rancid btw). After a month, there is now a thin white film on one side of the bottom of the bottle; I hope it is not contaminated or rancid. Screw that lid on tight, ladies!\n",

I am 27, acne prone, combination with sensitive light skin that seems to be getting more sensitive with age. I enjoyed the formula and did see results with brightening and smoothing of my forehead lines. I also used the extra-strength acid peels from dr. Gross(beautiful formula) and I bought the big $88 box. Together they work beautifully. This is an investment! It’s either this or I cheap out and use the ordinary Granactive retinoid serum. The difference of quality is obvious, the ordinary works but the formula isn’t as luxurious meaning it usually is more harsh and drying. Also since I have combination skin I needed something that worked well in both areas of my face. I’ve had recent bad hormonal breakouts so I needed to switch to something heavy duty and I’m on curology with a retinoid in my formula and it’s been tricky to keep motivated to keep with it because of how strong the formula seems to be. Once I feel my acne has calmed down I will probably switch back to the duo I was using. It’s just easier because you don’t go through that weird dry flaky phase(3rd month of it) and you can continue to incorporate other products without your skin freaking out (retinol wise).\n",

I will continue buying this product. I love it! Did not notice anything bad or an allergic reaction. Keeps my skin hydrated. Nothing bad to say about it but I’m not 5 stars amazed. I have been using this Tatcha firming serum for several years now. I love it as a base for cooler dryer months for its penetrating hydration. It has also tightened my skin significantly. After applying it seems has if there where invisible stings that gave me a lift. I use this has a base and use a cream moisturizer on top.

My pores look smaller and this doesn’t make my face greasy (I have an oily t-zone) or clog my pores. However, I wouldn’t repurchase this product because of the price tag and because I see no firming effects at all. There are other serums I love that are even more hydrating. I’m indifferent to this product so I recommend this serum but also, I certainly see no difference when not using it and I won’t be sad when I finish the bottle, nor will I repurchase it.

Haven’t found it super brightening but a nice addition to my weekly skincare. This is a reliable, multi-tasking serum. If you don't have a regimen, it's an awesome entry point to proven ingredients. When I first started using it going from 0 serum, it definitely helped. If you have a more involved skincare routine, it's probably not going to transform your skin - but it's all-in-one and gets the job done for a relatively moderate price.

I’ve tried EradiKate (flop) I used natural tea tree oil (great but I think my skin has become immune lol), tried peace out acne spots (another flop) & I was contemplating origins but I’ve heard mixed reviews.

I'm trying to put together a longer lasting solution (in terms of months of use, not while on face). Love the way my skin feels, is protected from UV with SPF, and the makeup holding power is good! Great over moisturizer and under foundation, doesn’t work so well under powder alone (pills up). Nice texture and good mattifying. It does feel like a primer when putting it on. Be careful, through, and put on a thin thin layer. If you try to put it on like sunscreen and rub it all over, it balls up. It’s perfect for a no foundation day, but if you want to put makeup on top of it just make sure you apply it gently and lightly. This is my everyday 'go to'. It makes my skin feel smooth and is a completely invisible barrier. It works as a primer and keeps my CC cream on. My skin feels softer and my pores are continually looking smaller. I have been using this serum for about eight months now and it has improved the redness and overall texture of my skin. I usually change products every six months or so because I like to try new products on the market, but I love this one so much, I have decided to stay with it. I notice the expression lines on my forehead are significantly decreased with use of this serum! I knocked off a star because it hasn’t gotten rid of all my fine lines and wrinkles. But it did quite a bit to my forehead expression lines! This was recommended by a Sephora employee but to be honest I have been using for a month now and have not noticed any significant difference. I will keep using until I finish the bottle since it was pricey but unless I see improvement, I won’t be purchasing again. Best thing I’ve ever bought. This has been the only thing to help with my acne. It cleared up my skin after one day. It is very drying. I would use every other day. It also helped my skin less oily. I have cystic acne that is persistent. It ebbs and flows and now that I’ve started a new birth control, I am breaking out like a hormonal teenager & I am 29. It’s embarrassing! I’ve been using this for just under a week now. I am acne prone with a very oily T-zone with combination skin. I never have a problem with staying moisturized because I’m so oily. However, this did try out my face immensely, AS EXPECTED, it is benzoyl peroxide! I use 2-3 pumps twice a day following my cleansing routine, then apply moisturizer. It drastically evened out my skin texture-wise. I only feel a few bumps when I cleanse & my skin is smooth!! Now to get rid of scarring. I can’t believe how quickly this helps rid of my cystic acne. I have only gotten one breakout since starting this within the last week! High hopes. I also love the ExfoliKate cleanser!!\n",

I was yes something moisturizing but something that wouldn’t clog my pores. Decided to give this a try. I’ve been using this for a few days now and one thing i love about this is that i can put this on under *and* over makeup. I like the dewy look it leaves on my face. You definitely do need to use 3-5 drops or else it feels like you have nothing on. Really feels the skin feeling hydrated and reapplying it over makeup feels rejuvenating.

I accidentally left it on for twice as long as the instructions said which caused my face to become extremely dry, but hey, my pimples were gone! I love this mask because it actually works! It is one of the only things that quickly gets rid of any acne I get. I use it as a mask if my skin is really struggling or as spot treatment if it's not as big of a deal. The only reason I can't give this mask 5 stars is the smell. It's definitely eggy, but honestly, worth it due to how well it works. A wonderfully hydrating serum, just wish you got more for what you pay. For the price point I expected real results and boy it did deliver. However as with other PTR products they tend to leave a sort of sticky film which causes me slight breakouts. The formula is lightweight loose and non greasy and I noticed immediate results after a few uses with my skin looking noticeably more plump. But then again the breakouts. I really like this product. Skin feels more hydrated. I use it at night before my moisturizer. Not a bad primer since it is matte. Def keeps my make up in place through out the day but i still have to blot my face during mid-day (only once though). The only problem i have with this product, it is kind of hard to put on and spread through out my face.Other than that, def. a satisfy customer. Basically just use this on my forehead because my hair sweeps to the side and I don't like the greasy feel on them. I would say I can stay matte for about 4 hours in cooler weather but not necessarily in summer. I'm not sure if this is normal or if I should be expecting more. This primer is for OILY skin. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else. Also please read the instructions. I didn't at first and thought I hated it. Then I read the instructions and applied it correctly and it performed great. Highly recommend for oily skin. Little tough on skin but effective Bought full size after receiving 2 samples in my Play subscription. I personally would not go so far to say Botox in a Box (for me). I did notice a change in my finer lines/wrinkles and have been using this product for a few months now. Will be trying more products from this brand. love everything in it BUT i HATE how this shade has yellow undertones. PLEASE make this shade without any bogus primary colors! This is honestly a savior for those who have acne or acne scars. Thank you. BUT, can we please get more range?????????!! Covers my scars really good after two coats. Does oxidize though so I’ll be purchasing again, just a shade lighter this time is all. I use it for pretty much my whole face and it lasts me a very long time. Considering price and coverage, I’d say this is a very good product. I really enjoy this product. I use many La Mer products but I'm disappointed to see the majority of them have gone up in price recently. Skin felt hydrated and calmed down. Love it.Just price is not nice. But quality is good for skin. Everyone at Sephora raves about this product. I got a sample of it and used it twice and my skin did feel softer. I want to use it more for full results. Truly love how this product feels after an hour!! Skin is so hydrated and glowing. Wished I could try samples of his new eye creams. love this product! Definitely helped my breakouts on my back and chest. Definitely would recommend this product for someone suffering from body breakouts. I wouldn't say this clears my acne, but definitely calms the skin and keeps the breakouts to a minimum. Interesting texture. Not sure if it works? My skin felt pretty smooth, but a bit overly sensitive afterwards. I was using this serum a few years ago and switched to quite a few different serums, that never quite did the job. I have combination skin with very dry sections around my chin and cheeks. I decided to repurchase as nothing I had used really helped with the dryness and I’m glad I did. While I can’t say it’s helped with fine line and wrinkles, this product, paired with my volition moisturizer really helped with the dry areas on my face. However, I cannot use this serum (or any serum or moisturizer for that matter) on its own and have to pair with a moisturizer. I switched to the rose deep hydration moisturizer and the combo just didn’t work for me as I still felt dry/tightness around my chin area. I just bought the lotus day and night cream, hopefully they pair nicely together.\n",

I feel that it helps keep my face from becoming too dry from the treatment. I would never use this during the day because I have oily skin and my face would probably look wet because it’s so hydrating. So if you’re looking for something for extra moisture for night, this would work out. Love the feel and great for my skin but the price for the size could be just a bit lower. Works good! Helped my dry skin all winter I don't know if it's working just yet. My skin feels better, I still have some breakouts on the chin. Do not get this in a cut, it stings. I have sensitive combination acne skin, so I wanted something that would really help my concerns. this product is great, because it extremely reduced my prescription and acne without extremely drying out my skin. A little goes along and it lasts forever. I've definitely noticed that it has reduced redness that I have on my cheeks. I enjoy the consistency, it is nice and light and is an easy addition to my night time skin routine. My only hesitancy about repurchasing is that the price point is higher than I would normally spend. I like this product. It’s like a light moisturizer (but I wear it under other moisturizers) and it doesn’t help with redness/itchiness on my cheeks (not rosacea, just sensitive/dry). I like the smell too, reminds me of neroli. I only gave it 4 stars because it’s a little pricey but if you buy it with the 20% it’s not terrible. Purchased this whole line during the VIB sale because my tried and true regimen had started causing me to have red itchy flare ups suddenly. This was recommended to me by the Sephora skin guru and it has really helped calm and soothe my irritated skin. I would definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from irritated skin. I absolutely love the scent, and the product feels great on my face! I’m honestly not seeing much of a difference, but it’s cooling!! This serum is one of the most moisturizing serums I have ever used. Instead of a clear gel consistency, it is milky and feels like a moisturizer. It doesn't leave skin feeling tight after drying and does help with redness. Great herbal scent as well Very rarely are products the \"real deal.\" This one is definitely one of them. Adding a few drops to my moisturizer daily brightened my skin so significantly that it mimicked the look of wearing a highlighter. Got so many compliments on my skin. The problem is that this product is not sustainable - it's ridiculously priced and only a 7 day use because it starts to oxidize rendering itself useless.

I bought this from Clinique a while ago to tackle the sebum that is always on my nose/only visible pore area. It is easy to apply; honestly, ignore the bad reviews about that. 1. Lightly dampen your problem area with cool water.** 2. Unscrew the white cap and squirt out a tiny bit (you don't need much) 3. Dab on the cream. It heats up in contact with the water. 4. Screw on the white/blue cap. 5. Rub the ridged end of the cap onto the area with some pressure. 6. Rinse off and apply toner / continue your routine. **The instructions say to put the cream on first and then water because if you're not careful, it will slide off, so you can also do cream first and then water. This is just my preference to feel more of the heat.** I use it 3-4 times per week, and a bottle lasts for a few months. I notice that the creases in my nose are clearer, but I still have daily sebum issues. So, this doesn't solve the problem, just halves it. Overall, I recommend it.\n",

      "…read more It has helped some in reducing puffiness but I'm still looking for a better product. Haven’t seen any real results but I love the formula. Some eye creams cause burning, this one hasn’t Have been using this for a month now and like it’s soothing to the eye area. I can’t say that every line around my eyes is gone, but I will continue using it. Also it’s one of the few serums good to use on eyelids. I use their corset cream all the time and definitely love it. The serum has a for sure tightening effect but I found it left a bit of residue. Would just stick with the cream next time! The cap doesn't close tight! That's the only down side. Everything else is very good. This works well to fill in deep lines. It soaks into the skin quickly. Love it, the scent, and the moisture The only con is lasting time very short, it lasts me only one and half month Dont really know about firm, but it leaves your face feel nice and smooth. Absorbs into the skin almost instant no greasy feeling. I found this hydrating and I loved the smell. It was a pleasure to use, but I didn’t notice any visible difference using it. I bought it for anti-aging benefits and the only one it satisfies is hydrating the skin to help prevent wrinkles. Maybe good for someone in their 20s as prevention. My dehydrated aging combo skin needs more. Won’t repurchase but it’s a nice product imo. Love it but too small and too expensive Love this! I've struggled with acne for three years and nothings worked this has! Only setback is after i got another bottle for some reason it didnt work? Not sure what happened but i'm gonna give it another go since the first time i used it was over night, my break outs were gone the next day. I enjoy the gel texture that glides easily onto my skin when I apply it. I have combination acne-prone skin that started flaring up after college graduation. Since then, I've been trying to find products to help clear it up once again. I already had an established routine that was working (slowly over time of course), but when I started implementing this treatment as well, I feel like it was working really well in conjunction. A little bit goes a long way so it'll last quite a while!\n",

The moisturizer is very light, but I imagine good 4 the skin The drying lotion, I haven’t tried yet. But, I’ve tried almost exact products by Mario B and Indee Lee . The Mario B & IL work as promised. This is a great kit to try out KS products. The packing box, is re useable. It’s a cute lil box with logo tissue paper...\n",
      "…read more So far really like this product! I’ve been using for for a week and my acne has cleared up a lot! It burned a lot in the beginning but now my skin is used to it. The face wash and spot treatment are my holy grail products. They are the only things that have been able to completely clear my skin so far. I can’t tell if the aches treatment does anything but it definitely didn’t hurt Great as a mask for shrinking pimples and dealing with acne. Waaaaaaay to harsh for spot treatment overnight. I learned the hard way and made two little pimples into a bigger thinggkk This product has turned into my #1 overnight spot treatment! I apply a thin layer before I go to sleep, and probably 8/10 times, the pimple is definitely diminished. Believe me, if this was a clear, gel-like spot treatment, it would be my day time spot treatment as well. The only learning curve is how intense the ingredients are. My first time, the mask burned/tingled a little bit, but the more you get used to it the better it becomes. I would be sure to moisturize in the morning when you rinse off the spot treatment to get your glow back:)\n",
      "…read more As someone who tends to pull a lot of late night works and all-nighters, this is awesome to put on before a nap or just a few hours of sleep. It doesn't solve all the problems, but it does even out my skin tones and soothes some blemishes. Love this product! Cleared up most of my acne scars within 2 weeks. It is a bit drying, I use it with the Murad pore control moisturizer I’ve been using this product for a little over 2 months now, and I do think it works. It has definitely lightened up the scars on my cheeks, forehead and chin. I would say I noticed the difference fairly early on, atleast 3-4 weeks into using it. I still put it on, mainly because there are still a few stubborn dark areas around my smile lines that haven’t caught up. Also, I noticed sometimes the gel tends to bleed outside the dark area I dotted it on, and there will be like a halo effect of lighter skin around the spot. Which, obviously I wasn’t trying to do, so I’m having to put really small tiny dots on the inner most dark area. The other thing I noticed, is that as the spots start to fade they also turn a little red, so now I’m seeing more faded red spots than anything. I put on spf 70 everyday before I leave the house just to make sure I don’t cause irritation. But honestly, I think the gel causes irritation anyway, especially if you have sensitive skin. It can sting a little if you have open scar or picked recently. All in all this product is good, it works, and it does as it is advertised. I’ve tried so many other dark spot correctors, Ambi, Clinique, and Proactive to name a few and they’ve never made a difference in my skin like Murad has. I find I’m at a point that I could go make up free on my cheeks, chin, and forehead if I wanted to. I just need these darn smile lines to catch up.\n",
      "…read more This seems to be effective, speeding up the process of repairing color changes in skin where a blemish has come and gone. If I get a pimple, I usually have a scar from it for about 2 months so I figured I'd give Murad a shot (first time using the brand but I know it's one of the best when you're trying to aggressively get rid of something--especially for acne). Anyway, I really liked the gel but I couldn't use it everyday because I started to get a rash where I was applying the gel (AKA the spot was getting bigger!). I'd still recommend this if you're trying to combat acne scaring because it really does do the trick; just be aware if you have sensitive skin as the healing process will likely take longer compared to people who can use it everyday.\n",
      "…read more I've been using this serum for the last two weeks, and although I love how it makes my skin feel, I can't tell if it's actually working. I definitely feel that it's hydrating my skin and that it's pulling moisture to keep my skin nice and healthy, I'm not seeing any bit of plumpness. It's got a good texture in the sense that it's water based and is very lightweight on the skin. Although I haven't seen any results, I still recommend it to anybody who is a little dry and needs a little bit more moisture pull!\n",
      "…read more My first bottle I used it all over my face as written. Through constant use it did its job in hydrating and smoothing my face a bit, but I decided to focus on an essence instead of a serum. So for your face, I would say it’s a take it or leave it product. However, a sales lady at a L’Oréal outlet store told me that it’s gentle enough to use under your eyes and that’s where it shines. And she was right! I’m currently using it as an eye serum or sometimes by itself and it is SO good! It really boosts my dehydrated eye area and is a better alternative to the Shiseido eye concentrate serum (also a good product but I would recommend this more). It’s a good travel product for short trips where you don’t want to pack a lot since it can double as eye and face care. Just bought another bottle during the sale!\n",
      "…read more it helps clear my pores out & leaves my complexion looking brighter. however, dont fly with it even if it’s in your carry-on ! unfortunate lesson i had to learn—the pressure change somehow caused the top of the gel bottle to loosen & my liquids bag was filled with it :( LOVE this and have purchased many times. Only downside for me, is I always run out of the activating serum before the scrubbing crystals are gone. I TRY to be frugal with the serum but I’m always left with scrub ti try to figure out what to do with. Would love if they provided more of the activator. This makes my face so smooth and pore-less. I do notice that I always have a couple of new bumps after I use this though. I really do like this product. Every time that I’ve used it, it left my skin feeling silky smooth. I’ve used it on and off for about 8 years. Let my sister try it the first time that I bought it and she still uses it on a regular basis too. My only issue with it is that I really do need to use measuring spoons. I also really wish that it came with more of the liquid, too. Plus, it’s pretty expensive. I believe I notice a firmer looking skin when I use this at night- once it quickly blends in I sometimes add a hydrating serum as well Noticing improvements already! I recently purchased this and have been using it for about 2 weeks as part of my nighttime skin routine. I have normal/combination skin (slightly oily), this product doesn’t dry my skin out like regular retinol. I’ve also noticed that my makeup also looks a lot smoother since incorporating this product.

I have tried many other exfoliates, and laura mercier gommage was my go too, not favorite but better than most. This is heaven! I love it! I am so glad I found you rice polish.

It's very gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean, without drying it out. It's pricy, but you need so little that it's actually pretty decent value for money. Even if I use a dime-sized amount daily, it's going to last months. I have very sensitive skin. I’m usually dry but sometimes get oily in my T-zone. This got rid of all the rough/uneven texture on my skin, and my skin looks so smooth now! I'm always skeptical of expensive skin care, but this has totally changed my skin, and it lasts forever. I've been using it for about a year now and its one of the few products that once I incorporated into my skin care I sw a noticeable difference in brighter, smoother skin. I use a small amount daily, just in the morning and its last a year. I chatted with someone about if it expires, but was told because it is a dry product, it shouldn't \"go bad,\" and I haven't noticed any change in quality.

      "…read more I’m not sure what kind of sorcery this is.... but I’ve just used it once and my skin has never felt SO smooth and healthy. It doesn’t even feel like it’s exfoliating or anything. It feels much like a cream wash or a foaming wash. I’m honestly shook. Amazing is incredible how soft leave this product your skin. I have very dry skin so I bought the oil cleanse and this one. I uses the oil on my dry face to remove the makeup and then this rice polish for a deep cleaning. Incredible best cleanse I’ve ever used. Baby skin for ever with this I’m pretty much addicted to tatcha products. This one quickly became a staple. My skin is typically dry, sensitive, and eczema prone. I pretty much use her whole line now, but this exfoliater powder I use twice a day. It took all my acne pigmentation right away without actually peeling my skin and going through a stage of flaky skin. My next jar will be the new indigo line catered to sensitive skin to try it out This is my holy grail face wash. I use it every single day, twice a day, and it leaves my face feeling so smooth every single wash. In the mornings when I don’t want as much exfoliating power, I rub it between my palms for longer than usual which creates a nice gentle lather. I forgot this at home when I went to Mexico for a vacation and noticed a distinct difference in my skin texture for the worse without it. I have acne prone skin and it never has broken me out. I got my mom addicted to this as well! It’s so so good.\n",
      "…read more Best physical exfoliant there is! It’s non scented and built from a product that naturally softens in water so it’s gentle on your skin. I find other physical exfoliants use products like walnut shells and coffee groundings - which do not grind to the same sizes AND do not break down with water. This can be very dangerous when your just scrubbing your face with it and if your anyone like me you go to town with exfoliants. This rice powder is gentle, safe and gets the job done. It’s well worth the price point because since it comes as a powder it lasts longer than you think as you use so little compared to a gel physical exfoliant! My favorite tatcha product!\n",
      "…read more Beautiful product! My skin has never been so soft. Pores appear smaller. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I chose this as a free sample last time I ordered from Sephora because I had heard and read rave reviews. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin so I have trouble finding effective exfoliants which are gentle enough for my skin. This did not disappoint. I liked it so much I ordered it immediately! I like how you can control the “grittiness” depending on how much water you use. I’ve also mixed it with my Avene cleanser. Expensive, but a little goes a long way. Updated On: February 12, 2020 I have now used this twice a day with my regular Avene cleanser for almost 3 weeks. My skin is super clear and soft. I really think this is worth the price tag.\n",
      "…read more Love this! Have been using it for almost a month and it’s helped my pores look smaller and my skin looks great!!! I love how soft this makes my face feel! It doesn't at all feel too harsh to use daily and leaves a wonderful ricey scent during my morning ritual. I have only been using this product for three days and OMG!!. My face was instantly exfoliated, brighten, and even toned. My husband commented on how bright and clean my face looked today. I just freaken love this. I have tried many other exfoliates, and laura mercier gommage was my go too, not favorite but better than most. This is heaven! I love it! I am so glad I found you rice polish. I first tried this product during an oxygenating facial at Sephora. I would never have thought to buy a \"just add water\" to this powder type of exfoliant, but it is excellent. I bought the Classic immediately and love it I have sensitive skin that reacts to practically everything. I love this cleanser. It's very gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean, without drying it out. It's pricy, but you need so little that it's actually pretty decent value for money. Even if I use a dime-sized amount daily, it's going to last months. I have very sensitive skin. I’m usually dry but sometimes get oily in my T-zone. This got rid of all the rough/uneven texture on my skin, and my skin looks so smooth now! I'm always skeptical of expensive skin care, but this has totally changed my skin, and it lasts forever. I've been using it for about a year now and its one of the few products that once I incorporated into my skin care I sw a noticeable difference in brighter, smoother skin. I use a small amount daily, just in the morning and its last a year. I chatted with someone about if it expires, but was told because it is a dry product, it shouldn't \"go bad,\" and I haven't noticed any change in quality. Because of how long it lasts and the noticeable results, it was definitely worth the cost for me. I was worried it would be too intense-- other types of exfoliates have irritated my skin, but this is so gentle I've had no issues.\n",

My next jar will be the new indigo line catered to sensitive skin to try it out The best toner! It makes your skin so soft and smells amazing. I'm obsessed with this product and this brand. My go-to toner. I've used this for years. every day- twice a day. This toner I use after I exfoliate my face in the shower and it keeps my face feeling fresh and tight. I absolutely love the smell! The fragrance is invigorating! A few splashes on the face and I’m good to go! Absolutely love this product. Worked so well for my dry skin. Plus the bottle with all the rose petals floating is gorgeous. Looks pretty and smells wonderful! Definitely is hydrating and non stripping like it claims. I wouldn't say it really tones or does anything to improve my pores other than being hydrating. I really enjoy using this mostly for the experience it provides. So far I am loving this product. It’s the first toner I’ve ever tried and I’m really happy I decided to try it! I have been applying it in the morning and at night followed with a moisturizer and my skin is glowing in the morning when I wake up. Love the packaging and the petals! It’s so pretty. I loveeeeeeee this toner.. I first got the travel size version to try it out for my large pores and went to get the bigger size a month after. This toner may be the nicest toner I’ve ever used. Would recommend for purchase, worth every penny! this is the most hydrating toner i've ever used. I have combination to oily skin and this works really well for my skin. It's hydrating enough without being oily, i'm on my second bottle now. Plus, it smells amazing (not overly fragrance) and looks beautiful on the counter. The only downside is the price. The best toner I have ever used. It smells wonderful, it is gentle, and my skin has never looked better. I use the strawberry exfoliating cleanser along with this and the Rose moisturizer to finish up. Fresh never disappoints my skin! It smells so nice I love how it makes my face feel . I have a back out one brought so I will never run out i’ve tried many toners but this one takes the cake. no redness on my face what so ever. the bottle lasts months! i use everyday with a cotton pad & it is so so so amazing. can’t say enough good things This product is really good. I just finished my third bottle and I have to say, it’s better than any other toner I’ve tried. The formula is hydrating and works well with other Fresh products (as it should). My only gripe is that once the bottle is running low, the rose petals in the bottle start to clog the nozzle when you’re trying to apply it to a cotton round. Life changing product!!! I honestly don’t write reviews and this is my first one because it truly deserves recognition. I can’t express enough how much this produce changed my skin. I have severely dry skin, but I also break out and have redness and this product addressed all those concerns in a matter of days. My skin hasn’t looked this good in so long!!

Such a great product to use after a long day wearing a full face! Just massage it onto dry skin and it will dissolve all of your makeup. LOVE!!!! I am so against makeup wipes due to them tugging your skin as you wipe, especially the eyes, so this balm is amazing. It gets all the make up off.

Love this product. Rub some in your hands and massage into your face. The makeup just melts away. It easily removes waterproof liner and mascara. I have very sensitive eyes and can massage this product into my lids and lashes with no discomfort. I wear makeup daily and use it at night only. One tub lasted nearly 3 months. My mom (who is 72) asked how this is different than a cold cream. This is not as creamy as a traditional \"cold cream\". It is a thick \"balm\" that leaves a thin film on your face and is very easily washed off with water. I follow with a simple cleanser (cetaphil is my favorite), to get any remaining residue off.

      "…read more after trying so many products to fight my acne I was super skeptical about this one since didn’t think toner could do much. But decided to give it a try after reading all the positive reviews. I was shocked. After first use it healed my skin and blemishes looks so much brighter! I’m in love with this product. I am amazed by this product! I was hesitant at first, as this product has salicylic acid in it and wondering if using it once daily would dry out my skin. I've been using this product for almost a month and I've had nothing but great results. I wouldn't consider myself to have oily skin (I'm more combination skin) but the ingredients salicylic acid and glycolic acid are great for sloughing off dead skin cells and removing dirt and excess sebum. While I wasn't miracles, as I've dealt with somewhat cystic acne for years, it has really improved my skin by shrinking my pores like it says it does, providing that extra deep clean without damaging the skin, and seems to be speeding up the healing process of previous blemishes/pimples. I also follow-up with a glycolic acid night cream. When using glycolic acid products, sunscreen is a must since glycolic acid acts in the same way as a facial scrub or mild facial peel. I also really love the tingling feeling after applying it, as it gives me a deep clean feeling without being too stripping of natural oils. Bonus is that it's under Sephora's 'Clean Beauty' products. Love that too. As you can tell, I am loving this product and it's been a game changer for me. I've been quite satisfied using other Olehenriksen products as well and this experience definitely gives me more confidence in trying out other products from this line.\n",

      "…read more after trying so many products to fight my acne I was super skeptical about this one since didn’t think toner could do much. But decided to give it a try after reading all the positive reviews. I was shocked. After first use it healed my skin and blemishes looks so much brighter! I’m in love with this product. I am amazed by this product! I was hesitant at first, as this product has salicylic acid in it and wondering if using it once daily would dry out my skin. I've been using this product for almost a month and I've had nothing but great results. I wouldn't consider myself to have oily skin (I'm more combination skin) but the ingredients salicylic acid and glycolic acid are great for sloughing off dead skin cells and removing dirt and excess sebum. While I wasn't miracles, as I've dealt with somewhat cystic acne for years, it has really improved my skin by shrinking my pores like it says it does, providing that extra deep clean without damaging the skin, and seems to be speeding up the healing process of previous blemishes/pimples. I also follow-up with a glycolic acid night cream. When using glycolic acid products, sunscreen is a must since glycolic acid acts in the same way as a facial scrub or mild facial peel. I also really love the tingling feeling after applying it, as it gives me a deep clean feeling without being too stripping of natural oils. Bonus is that it's under Sephora's 'Clean Beauty' products. Love that too. As you can tell, I am loving this product and it's been a game changer for me. I've been quite satisfied using other Olehenriksen products as well and this experience definitely gives me more confidence in trying out other products from this line.\n",
      "…read more I absolutely love this toner. I had difficulty finding a toner that doesn't feel like I'm stripping my face but also gives me that clean, dry feeling. It feels so refreshing after using and since using it, I've noticed a lot less redness, unevenness, and blemishes on my face. I have sensitive skin and this hasn't bothered my skin at all. I'm so glad I finally found something that works for me. I love it, is a must have product! I use for my skin care, and also when I do my makeup. Sometimes my face look dry because the setting powder etc.. and I just spray and my face look really smooth, and sometimes I don’t even need a setting spray because this product does the job. I just don’t like the smell. Fresh, Fresh. I'm a bit of a collector of face sprays and really love this one but I feel like after I've had it 2 months that the scent has changed a little. Like it Like it Like it Like it Like it Like it Like it Like it Like it Love in a bottle. I love this stuff so very much. I spray it on under my makeup, over my makeup, throughout the day. Often, I use it very often. It is so refreshing and the perfect spritz to start the day. Did I mention that I love it? This is my fourth bottle and I am never going to stop repurchasing! I purchased the Caudalie Favorites set, and started using this as a means to possibly add more moisture to my skin post makeup. During the winter my skin has a tendency to feel super tight, and then in a few hours, look super oily with sliding makeup. I sprayed this on with few expectations and noticed that my pores looked smaller throughout the day, there seemed to be less oil excretion, my makeup was staying put, and my skin felt comfortable to wear. An added bonus is this is refreshing and smells so good. I also love the packaging. A huge pet peeve is when I put bottles in my bag and the top comes off ( especially when the bottles are spray bottles). The top stays on so well and is a pleasure for travel use.\n",

      "…read more I just really feel like this gets in my pores and cleans out. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and I’m a month in. My skin looks clear and clean. This is one of the few cleansers that leaves my skin actually feeling clean, but not dry. I pair it with the exfoliator once a week in the shower, and love the results! Love this cleanser it leaves my skin feeling hydrated. Excellent so far .. on my 3rd bottle and it’s been so helpful to create a good clean surface for my serums to go deeper . Best face cleanser ever made for problematic skin . I will never use another cleaner. Only cleanser that cleans oily skin and pores properly without causing irritation. I’ve using this product for two years and will continue to repurchase. You only need a very small amount each time, so it lasts a long time. I did not want to fall in love, but I did. I had a breakout of hormonal acne and this cleanser literally saved me. I did a little face mask with it last night and can basically host the Oscars now. Kate Somerville is upscale but it gave me hope during this awful breakout. Hands down the best face wash ever. My face feels so clean and tight after using. I have dry skin but this doesn’t dry my skin out at all. I will definitely keep buying!!!! This cleanser is surprisingly gentle enough for me to use on my acne prone, extremely sensitive skin once a day. It is very hard for me to find products that are effective and also don't irritate my skin so I'm happy to have found this. I'm now on my second tube of this and am still doing well using it. Game changer. Get the 8oz. ;) I use it morning and night and it's helped my deep adult acne clear up significantly in 2 weeks. I love Kate's whole line. I used Kate Somerville DTX Daily cleanser for years and it had been discontinued when I went to repurchase it. I decided to give this cleanser a try and I am so happy I did. After the first use I noticed smoother, softer skin. This is way better than the DTX cleanser, which I have loved for years. Leaves your skin feeling refreshed and clean without being dry or tight and removes all of my makeup with one wash. Will definitely repurchase this product.\n",

After a little physical exfoliation with a washcloth and a layer of KS oil-free moisturizer and I’m good to go. I use this in combination with the EradiKate line and my skin has never looked better! This product is incredible! I’m one of the “fortunate” ones in life to still be dealing with acne at 30. This product has cleared up my skin so quickly. The gentle exfoliation has really helped. I’ve used several Murad cleansers since I have been trying to stick to one line, but this product is incredible. It’s cleared up, the texture is getting better, and my skin tone is improved. Will continue to purchase! My new fave. The price hurts, but this is seriously the best face cleanser I have ever used. It legitimately makes me enjoy washing my face. People have talked about skin care being like relaxing self care, and I never thought of it that way until this haha. It feels so nice, cleans really well and leaves your skin super smooth. I got this in a set with the spot acne treatment and the green exfoliant. I have pretty dry skin so I have to use these products sparingly. I have seen a huge difference in the smoothness, texture and the amount of acne I get. I have struggled with mild acne since my teenage years and nothing worked to prevent my acne only treat it. I have finally found something that is effective yet gentle. Tip: if it causes dryness use less frequently and use a face oil to moisturize (I use drunk elephant marula oil).\n",

No more little bumps, highly minimized blackheads, and a smooth feeling is left to my skin.

Been using this for a while and i can see an improve on my skin! The calendula helps a lot when my face feels itchy or not well. One of the best! This doesn’t strip your skin at all. I put it on after cleansing and my skin drinks this up; making it feel moisturized. I have textured skin, and I have seen an improvement. My skin feels softer, looks smoother, and moisturized. I love this toner! I really like this one! I use this one in the morning since it's smoothing, balancing and gentle, and I also use it on the nights that I use a strong serum like retinol. It never makes me red or break out, just goes on really nicely. I think it makes great toner if you're looking to gently balance your skin before applying serums or moisturizer. It does give a little glow, but this is a very mild product. You're not going to see crazy results from this toner on its own, but will prime you for the next step of your skin care routine. I have this toner and then a strong toner for other purposes. The petals do get on your cotton pad, but they don't ever end up on my face. They stick to the pad, so I wouldn't let that deter you.

This helps with my cystic acne but is still gentle enough for me to use every day. I had randomly gotten a small sample from Kiehl's and was ecstatic to see that Sephora had it too! Smells nice and it feels moisturizing. I have oily/combo skin. I do think it makes me less oily (I still have shine), but it's not drying. I've already bought a second full sized bottle! This product really helps my acne prone oily skin. It has really helped with my oil production. It's also so soothing and it doesn't break me out at all. The scent smells like honey to me and putting it on my face is so soothing. It also doesn't make my face feel sticky like some toners do. The bottle came broken but, of course, Sephora replaced it for me! I love this. It's very soothing before going on with the skincare routine. I’ve been using this for years. I was struggling with acne when I first got introduced with this product and it hydrated my skin without stinging. It helped me clear my acne scars. I’ve tried so many different brands of toners after my acne was cleared but nothing was as gentle and hydrating as this! I absolutely love this toner. I’ve been using this toner for quite some time and it’s been always refreshing for my skin. One day I decided to change toner and it was a worst decision ever. I’ve got small bumps all over my forehead and chin. Then I immediately switched back into this toner, after two days the bumps disappear!! Like my forehead and chin turns out really smooth again! It may not helps with acne or dark spots, but for small bumps—this is a holy grail and it smells wonderful!\n",
      "…read more This is my go-to toner. It helps with redness and inflammation. I get breakouts a lot and this definitely has helped. This is the best toner I have tried so far. It is gentle enough that I have been able to use it as part of my morning skin care routine nearly every day. It doesn't have a super strong astringent smell. It doesn't BURN MY FACE. I have noticed my skin's texture is smoother and I have been using it maybe a week and a half to two weeks, and not even super consistently (I'm terrible) I'm really hoping to lock down my routine and I think this is a keeper.\n",
      "…read more I’ve been using this product for over a week now, I LOVE IT. it definitely lives up to its expectations. I have oily combo skin. It has definitely reduced my redness, controlled my oiliness just like the description says. It has made my skin feel better than ever before! I use to always skip using a toner, and now I literally can’t live without it. Love this toner! Been using this for a while and i can see an improve on my skin! The calendula helps a lot when my face feels itchy or not well. One of the best! This doesn’t strip your skin at all. I put it on after cleansing and my skin drinks this up; making it feel moisturized. I have textured skin, and I have seen an improvement. My skin feels softer, looks smoother, and moisturized. I love this toner! I really like this one! I use this one in the morning since it's smoothing, balancing and gentle, and I also use it on the nights that I use a strong serum like retinol. It never makes me red or break out, just goes on really nicely. I think it makes great toner if you're looking to gently balance your skin before applying serums or moisturizer. It does give a little glow, but this is a very mild product. You're not going to see crazy results from this toner on its own, but will prime you for the next step of your skin care routine. I have this toner and then a strong toner for other purposes. The petals do get on your cotton pad, but they don't ever end up on my face. They stick to the pad, so I wouldn't let that deter you. It's totally harmless. You don't feel it.\n",

Wonderful for my EXTREMELY sensitive skin - anything makes my cystic acne worse and I have to be so cautious with acids/toners/alcohols in particular. This helps with my cystic acne but is still gentle enough for me to use every day. I had randomly gotten a small sample from Kiehl's and was ecstatic to see that Sephora had it too!

It does leave a bit of dryness but not as much compared to other face washes I’ve used. I can handle this feeling because afterwards I will follow up with a hydra serum, and then an oil based sunscreen. My face feels incredibly soft like never before.

I love everything about this cleanser the feel, the smell, and the results! I have been using this product every day for the past couple of months and my skin feels smooth, soft, and clear! Great for soothing red and irritated skin. My daughter loves this product. She has very red cheeks and this products calms the redness. I have never bought a moisturizer from Sephora. I only use Cetaphil oil control moisturizer for many years. Im hooked on the Aqua Bomb. Absolutely love the dewy finish. A little goes a long way! I absolutely love the belif ! I use it everyday along with the face wash and toner I’m beyond obsessed with this skin care line ! This stuff is magic. I have this to thank for no wrinkles at 40:) This is the most refreshing hydrating product I have ever tried! This moisturizer makes my face feel so amazing! I feel like it helped my acne a little as well. I’ve been on accutane for 2 months now, this is seriously the best moisturizer I’ve tried. If you’ve heard of accutane or been on it, you know how extremely drying it is. My skin was starting to flake off, and this stuff basically saved me. It also made my skin extremely sensitive, but I’ve had no adverse reaction to this! I have always struggled with dry damaged skin and since i started using thai product my skin is always so smooth and moisturized. If you have been looking for good moisturizer i would definitely recommend this product i will definitely forever use this product. I love this stuff! Honestly, works good and smells good. Doesn’t leave sticky residue on face! Recommend ! Have been using this for about 6-7 months and I can say I love it. I have tried other products but continue to go back to this. Only use it in the mornings along with the rest of my products and I love it, I literally can’t live without it! You won’t regret buying this My skin looks beautiful and shiny since I use it, it has helped me make my makeup look much better and my skin smoother I am 35, and have combo skin that has become less oily in my T-zone and more parched on my cheeks. I am surprised to say this works, with a caveat. It works exceptionally well at improving the appearance of a scar that I have on my forehead, as well as significantly diminishing the wrinkles on my forehead. Like other reviewers, when I first started wearing this, it dried quickly and I felt that it wasn't moisturizing enough. However, I kept using it, and would sometimes add another more occlusive moisturizer on top ( I prefer heavier moisturizers). I am in week 3 of using it, and hate that I like it so much. If you like heavy moisturizers (FAB, DE Protini, Belief Moisture Bomb), then this will take some getting used to. Also, I think the differences in reviews might stem from the skin you start with. I don't see this cream doing wonders for my cheeks (I don't have any problems there - in fact I need more moisture there), but I see it doing wonders for my forehead where I have wrinkles, a scar and had teenage acne).\n",
      "…read more LOVE. Got it in the Sephora collections package for Christmas and it makes my skin glow. I am not a huge fan of the smell but my skin is so soft from it. I’ve been using it AM & PM. I don't want to love this moisturizer because of the price tag but I always end up coming back. I have red sensitive skin and after using this at night my skin looks so calmed and less inflamed. I've taken a break from using this for a month or longer and then after just one application the results are obvious. It's moisturizing without being greasy or leaving a residue. OMG. My 60 year old skin has never been this hydrated. Fine lines are gone! I love this product. I was resistant to purchasing because it it pricey, but I found I purchased far fewer products to get the results I receive from using this exquisite moisturizer. I have purchased both versions of this cream and both are excellent. I really love this moisturizer! The first week I tried it I was concerned because I broke out( I have very sensitive skin) but after that my skin cleared up and was very glowy and moisturized..worth the price point if you are debating it..I have combination skin and this product got me threw the winter months... I really love this cream! I have nothing negative to say about it as it is keeping my skin looking happy, healthy and plump. I am 30 now and want to take the best care that I can and this cream definitely helps. I do not use a lot and a 15ml jar lasts me 3-4 months. I also mix it with Juno oil and that helps me use less as well. It is pricey but I try to buy when Sephora has 20% off so that helps! La Mer has a strong celebrity following for a reason — it works! I don’t get all the negative reviews from people who received free samples. The soft cream is a staple in my skincare routine. I’ve used this for many years and it keeps my skin hydrated with very few visible wrinkles, despite my age. My skin is sensitive to almost every moisturizer out there but La Mer soft cream never breaks me out. Sometimes tried-and-true, simpler products are better. La Mer is great and they don’t need neon packaging or fake reviews to sell their stellar products.\n",
      "…read more worth every penny! keeps skin hydrated and really fresh looking I gave it a 5-star because it delivers what it promises. Other than that, there is no “WOW” factors that those current skincare offers. If you want a luxurious cream without any skin irritations, this is for you. I personally look for anti-aging products with highlight ingredients so I found this product is mediocre to my taste. I like it afterall, but will not repurchase. I have combination skin and this stuff works like magic! On nights when I want a little more moisture I mix in a couple of drops of facial oil. Have already repurchased twice now! I use it as a face cream and it makes your skin un\"belif\"ably smooth lol This moisturizer is a must have ! It’s keeps my skin soft and supple all day without a greasy feel. It smells so nice and my skin “drinks” it right up. This product is a life saver in this dry California air! It does an amazing job of moisturizing without clogging pores and leaves skin feeling light and refreshed all day! This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. I was hesitant at first because I have such sensitive acne prone skin, but it doesn’t break me out at all. 10/10 worth the price and it’s something I can never stop buying. This product is amazing! Not greasy, sinks into the skin really fast but you don’t have to keep on applying to feel moisturized. It’s incredible. One of the best moisturizers on the market. Gentle, insanely hydrating in a non-greasy way, leaves my skin so supple and firm, and smells like HEAVEN. I look forward to putting this on before bed, it instantly relaxes me. AMAZING! THE BEST CREAM I HAVE TESTED IN MY LIFE. MY SKIN HAS CHANGED, IT IS REALLY THE BEST INVESTMENT A clean, gentle moisturizer I like to apply at night. It can also be used in the day time, but does not contain spf so be sure to supplement with sun protection. My skin is soft with no breakouts! I’ve used this for over a year now, a little goes a long way for me. A little thicker and more moisturizing than the gel formula so it’s great for dry skin Been using this moisturizer for years. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and the ingredients in this product are very safe and have not given me any concerns. Also, this product Really helps my skin stay balanced. I live in Florida so lots of got to air conditioned spaces and having a good moisturizer is critical. This product easily applies over serums and goes very well under spf. I buy tons of this stuff every year. Highly recommend to anyone with combo skin but even dry skin.\n",

My parents got me a thing of samples of all different products for Christmas and this was my favorite!!! My skin wasn’t flakey, it didn’t feel dry and tight anymore. Ok I literally never review products but had to for this! I have perpetually dry skin and nothing seems to moisturize my face without it drying out by end of day. But this product leaves my face soft and hydrated all day! I use it along with the belif aqua jelly cleanser. Love both! This is my everyday face makeup. It provides enough (sheer) coverage for me without looking heavy or caked on at all. My go-to. Has a silky coverage and is not cakey at all. Makes my blemishes and pores less noticeable but doesn't feel like I have make up on at all. And it's SFP 30! I have extremely temperamental, sensitive, unpredictable skin. I can truly say that this is the only cosmetic face product/foundation that I can confidently apply without worrying about it causing weird flaking, dryness, redness, not rubbing in properly, etc. This is the only foundation-type product I can apply with my fingers in 30 seconds when I’m running late and I know it will still look great. It’s so low maintenance and always look nice. Please, please never stop making this product. It is the only thing that works for my sensitive skin and my busy lifestyle!\n",
      "…read more I'm 45 and I've NEVER liked the feel of foundation. I've only purchased a few in my time, but have always opted for tinted moisturizers instead. I came across this a couple of years ago, and have been very happy. Tried another brand recently, just cuz, and it was a good comparison...and testimony as to how good THIS tinted moisturizer is. I'm actually not a huge advocate for sunscreen on a daily basis b/c we need Vitamin D. And the little bit of sun I get, going about my daily business, isn't enough to warrant sunscreen, IMO. I also have a lot of melanin in my skin, so I'm fortunate there (less risk of skin cancer). That being said, I LOVE that this SPF is mineral based. The typical chemical based sunscreens are hormone and endocrine disruptors. My life has changed since I started removing all of the chemical junk from my skin and body care. My periods are more regulated, with less cramping. bareMinerals does a really great job at keeping their products clean. I just switched to their blush b/c of this, and am super happy with it, as well. The coverage is great with this, while still providing moisture and movement in the skin. And I love that the colors blend so well. I'm a 6 Ginger in winter, and a 9.5 Terra in the summer. In spring and summer, as my skin transitions color, I mix the two. Overall, IMO, this is the best there is. It offers everything you could possibly need!!\n",

I tend to not want to wear make up unless I have to. But then, I look like death. This product allows me to have just a bit of coverage and color but still feels so light. This is by far my favorite cosmetic product that I’ve ever used (and I’ve used many over the years)! I’ve been complimented so many times and asked what I have on my face. Even on days I don’t want to wear makeup, I still always at least apply this. It evens out my skin, adds a touch of glow and looks very natural. My 3 daughters, my sister, friends and mother-in-law all use it now too. I also love that it has SPF 30 in it.\n",
      "…read more This is my go-to everyday product. When not using foundation, this is what I use and it provides just enough coverage but is also very light on my skin. I really like using it during the summer especially since it has SPF. It feels as though I've searched forever for a foundation that provided just the right amount of coverage to even out my skin tone, but still looks natural. I have freckles and if I can't see them (full coverage foundation) I don't feel like myself. This provides everything I wanted - good color, SPF, just the right coverage, and extra moisturizing for my dry skin. I regularly purchase this product. It is so light in texture that it looks like you are not wearing make up. It does a great job covering blemishes on your skin that are not dark. I absolutely love this stuff. I have super dry skin and I’m on acutane. This is the only makeup I can put on without my skin instantly drying up again. A little goes a long way and it’s super light on the skin! This has been my go-to tinted moisturizer for every day use for almost two years now. When I say every day I don’t mean for work, I mean running errands, grabbing lunch, wanting to look a little more put together. (For work, going to dinner ect I like a fresh, satin/dewy medium coverage foundation.) Sinks into my skin beautifully not bringing attention to texture or dry patches. You cannot tell I have anything on my face, while it evens out any discoloration or blemishes. Sometimes I will tap a little concealer to blemishes and my under eyes, but you don’t necessarily need it. I literally will rub it with my finger tips and it looks so natural! Highly recommend!\n",
      "…read more Love this product so much. I’ve probably gone through about 6 tubes of this stuff but it truly is my perfect everyday base. It lightly evens out the skin tone, so it would look great by itself on a no-makeup makeup day, but also plays well with most concealers to amp up the coverage. It always gives my skin the most beautiful, luminous glow and I really can’t imagine using another everyday base product. I love this product so much. Have been using it for a few years and my skin has always had the right amount of moisture since I’ve used it. I apply this first thing every morning and then apply Bare Minerals foundation over it. Its the best tinted moisturizer I’ve ever used!! Actually this is only one that doesn’t contain silicones and other comedogenic ingredients! Thats why I love it so much. It doesn’t cause new breakouts and the same time hydrate the skin. But I’m very sad that Birch 1.5 is out of stock. Please bring back Birch . I had originally purchased another “dry skin” moisturizer that didn’t work out so I decided to grab this one instead. I am super happy with how soft and moisturized this makes me feel! It’s still winter here and this soaks right in leaving no dry patches. I feel like it’s also light enough to wear in the warmer months because my skin drinks it up. It has a light fragrance, but it doesn’t irritate my skin and the smell disappears after a short time. Highly recommend trying this!\n",
      "…read more A Sephora rep recommended this for me as I wanted something to put on before foundation and while I love Charlotte tilbury, it’s expensive. This was cheaper and you get a lot more product. I love it, it soaks in quick and doesn’t bother (patchiness, etc.) the foundation. I have oily skin and this product hydrates my skin without making it more oily. Lasts a long time too as you don’t need to use much each time. My #1 HOLY GRAIL. This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. Before I got this, Michigan winters were so hard on my skin and I could not find anything that helped my dry flaky patches on my forehead and cheeks. I was so self conscious about it and I couldn't even wear makeup because it looked so bad! I noticed a difference with this moisturizer immediately and love that even though it's thick it sinks into your skin so effortlessly. When I ran out last week I started using a different one until I could restock and within a day my skin was back to its old ways and was soo angry!! If you have struggled to find anything to help with your dry skin, buy this and you won't regret it!\n",

I thought I would give CereVe moisturizer for a try since I like the face wash and didn’t have the money for this one, and I missed this product so much! This is a fantastic product and is a fair price. I recently moved to a drier climate that has very cold and harsh wind. Quickly, my skin was suffering when the winter came around. I ran out my previous moisturizer and came out of the store with this one. I’ve been using it for about a month, day and night. I’ve seen tremendous improvements in the texture of my skin. I am usually acne prone with red scarring (mostly hormonal and stress induced) along with horrible dry patches on my cheeks and nose. My skin is now very smooth and soft because of this moisturizer. It does not clog my pores or cause breakouts and is very soothing. I also use it on my hands and occasionally my legs!\n",

It's affordable and it works better than most products I've tried on my skin. It helped with dryness and actually brightened my skin. Love it! I found this a few years ago and haven’t looked back. I initially used it solely on my face when I was dealing with some pretty bad dryness. Now I use it all over. It drys down fairly quickly and leaves my skin soft and hydrated. I have atopic dermatitis in almost my entire body including my legs, arms and between legs. I have used prescription products and medicines by my dermatologist and this specific product is the one that has taken me out of the worst with the condition, I love it, I hope it never sold out or not exist anymore. This winter my skin has been dryer than usual, and let me tell you, this sAVED MY SKIN. Being acne prone, I was nervous but this hasn't broken my skin out at all. I would highly recommend it, it also never burns dry skin like other creams!! I love this! It works for my normal to oily skin very well. Does not break me out at all and all the ingredients are safe for my sensitive skin. It comes with a lot of product so you get your money’s worth! If you’re thinking about purchasing a cream for your face try this. About to purchase my 4th 6 oz container. Shortly after giving birth my face would get super dry and red spots. I was trying all kinds of moisturizers and remedies. 6 years later of finding this product I haven't looked back! No crazy breakouts, very smooth transition to my morning routine. I have acne prone skin. Very acne prone skin. Most of it is hormonal - but I’ve been struggling with it for years. I also have pretty combination skin, I’m not always very dry but I’m not always oily either. During the winter months, my skin flakes underneath my makeup like crazy. My skin will feel moisturized and I put my makeup on and suddenly my skin is flaming everywhere and looks disgusting. This moisturizer changed the game. I won’t use anything else now. I feel so sorry for those who said it makes them break out because I’ve had nothing but a great experience with this moisturizer. I think that’s a true testament to say that everyone reacts differently to things. Even after using a cleanser one day that was too much for my skin, this moisturizer soothed my skin like no other. I can’t believe I didn’t hear about this earlier!!! I always thought using heavy moisturizers was the key to curing dry skin, if you use a little bit, this feels light AND moisturizes your skin like no other. Will never use another product!\n",

Now I'm using this on nearly my whole body every night, and my \"hot\" spots every day. I love the feel of it, the subtle normal lotion smell, and I am definitely going to get the tube next time. My ultimate HOLY GRAIL moisturizer. I have very dry skin and this helps a lot to stop sensitivity on my face when my skin is dry and itchy. So I won’t lie. I do not gravitate toward Clinique because it always reminded me a more mature skincare/makeup line. I received a sample with a Sephora purchase and was instantly obsessed.

I'll have to see how this works for me during the summer but I'm hopeful it won't leave me feeling too oily. It also works well under my liquid foundation (which I rarely wear) or under powder sunscreen (my daily sunscreen). My only disappointment with this product is the container. Although I always have clean hands when using, I would prefer a pump to minimize introduction of contaminants. Just FYI, aside from the largest size (which is the cheapest per ml), the 1.7 oz/50ml is the cheapest per ml. I guess they assume most people won't calculate it.\n",

I use it at night before bed, but if I'm not wearing make-up I'll use it in the mornings at home. It makes my skin feel soft and dewy without being too \"wet\" if that makes sense. The only reason I don't use it under make-up is because I use a SPF moisturizer if I'm going out; thus, am putting make-up on. I even use it on my eyes and it doesn't irritate them at all, so I no longer use a separate moisturizer for my eyes, even better!\n",

But what it does do — and does it amazingly — is prep your skin to a moisture level that is prime and ready for foundation. It seems to just normalize skin moisture so that your foundation seeps in nicely and imparts a sort of “glow” to the final outcome. I don’t use this on very humid days. But being in Vegas, humidity is not a big issue. On hot summer days, I also don’t use this because my combo skin doesn’t need more moisture. But for the rest of the year, especially on days where my regular moisturizer feels like it wasn’t *quite* enough — this is the primer I go to. I scoop out a small amount onto my palm, and dab a bit onto my cheeks, forehead and chin, and then I rub it in all over, including my eyes, prior to putting on foundation.\n",

This tinted moisturizer is great because it's thick enough for good coverage, but the consistency isn't so heavy that it ends up cakey.

It's one of the best creams in my life. My skin very moisturized and has nice and healthy glow Where have you been all my life? My skin has been sooo dry and irritated this winter and for whatever reason it’s taken me forever to try this stuff. The Ceramidin liquid in conjunction with this is HG product status. This cream is super thick, but sinks into my skin so well, I can wear it day or night. I get the hype now! Received as 100 point perk and I love it because right now in Hawaii the weather is very bipolar and I live in a raining area. So my combination/sensitive skin deals with the dryness and it helped me calm down my skin I live in the tropics but my skin is very dry, and I also work under A/C. So my skin gets even more dry. This cream feels so smooth and nourishing. Have been using it for several days (day and night) and my skin looks like when I was 25. Highly recommended. What a godsend during the winter time. Being new to the dry weather, I’ve exclusively been using this as my main moisturizer to repair all the damage done throughout the day. It works so well, I don’t know how I survived without it before Saved my skin from the ravages of Canadian winter. Wish I had known about it sooner. One tube bought in November is still going strong into Feb. I love love love it. Not sure if it works the same during the warmer months. Maybe just for night then. Will find out, definitely plan to continue using. Tip. Apply it to wet skin then massage. It traps the moisture in. I have very dry and sensitive skin, but this worked wonders. It’s a little pricey, but worth the investment. Doesn’t clog my pores and gives me a nice hydrated glow! Also, intertwined and somewhat hidden in the box is a little plastic thing to help push product out! Don’t throw away the box with out it! Life saver for when you’re running low!

My skin is very prone to breakouts and I find this to be one of the only moisturizers I can use that won't cause a breakout while offering the moisture my skin needs. I perfect combination, not too light, not too heavy. Been using this for a decade. Any time I have tried something else.. my skin doesn't look as good. Dewy, hydrating and not greasy. The bottle lasts a long time too! I got this moisturizer for my birthday. I have combination dry skin and had dry flaky patches on my forehead, nose and right eyelid. My makeup would cling to these areas and make it look bad. But you had to be up close to see it. My forehead was my biggest problem area. I’ve only used this TWICE. Two times. And my dry spots were gone! It’s like magic! I’d love to see what my skin looks like with the rest of the system.\n",
      "…read more I love Clinique’s DDML. I’ve used it for 45 years. I have tried to replace it with other moisturizers along the way, but nothing works as well. It’s great for night and day, and it works especially well under makeup. I have normal skin with a tendency to contact dermatitis. There are certain ingredients I can’t use. DDML has never caused problems. It is fragrance free. I also use the Clinique mild bar soap for cleansing. I’ve never found anything to replace that, either. A lot of cleansers (for example, Cetaphil) give me a rash. In the worst months of winter, I sometimes use Moisture Surge Intense over this. People still compliment me on my skin. I have very few lines, smooth texture, and I don’t have enlarged pores. One caveat, know your skin type! Cleansers and moisturizers are geared to skin type. If you have oily skin, this will probably be too much moisture.\n",
      "…read more This is by far my favorite moisturizer! I love the whole 3 step system. Even when I try new cleaners, I still fall back on this moisturizer. My go to moisturizer! I have combination to dry skin and my skin feels still tight and dry with other moisturizers but this one works well with my skin! Its light but moisturize my skin well:) I've been using it for a while now. Although I have combination skin, it became very dry when I moved to a new climate. I was introduced to this product by a friend and found that it worked really well, and did not cause me any outbursts of acne as most moisturizers have. It is a great solution for those with combination skin who live in dry climates. I love this product!! I always find myself going back to this moisturizer. It’s lightweight and not greasy feeling on my face. I recommend that everyone tries it. My face feels so hydrated and it doesn’t break me out I'm not sure that this is supposed to have properties that clear my skin but I noticed a HUGE difference in my redness after just one day of using this. I have UBER sensitive skin and this is just a wonderful product. I don't find that it sit on top of my skin, it's not greasy and it really does hydrate. I use this at night but have no doubt it would lay very nicely under makeup or just on it's own. This product is very moisturizing and easily repairs dry skin! I've been using this moisturizer for years and years now, and yet I've only gone through 3 bottles! It lasts for SO long - the price is very fair for what you get. I use this every night (during the day I prefer the Clinique Jelly or Chanel Camelia Water) and it's wonderful - the texture is very rich but lightweight at the same time (don't know how they pulled that off), it feels so comfortable on the skin and you only need very very little! If you use too much, you might not like it - less is more with this one. I only use half a pump because it's not necessary at all to use more. It leaves my skin supple and hydrated (and this is coming from someone using Retin-A!). I love it, and the fact that it comes in a pump makes me love it even more!\n",
      "…read more Holy. Grail. I have been looking for a moisturizer that actually soaks into my face instead sitting on top of it but doesn’t leave my face feeling heavy. I actually use this as a day cream and for the first time in over a decade went foundation free because of the nice glow and radiance this gives my skin. The smell is a but musty like old gym shoes but it doesn’t linger at all once you rub it in. It took me about a week to fall in love with it. I don’t care about the lack of scent. I prefer unscented, but I don’t smell what others smell. It’s just a scent free cream. There’s no crazy odor. I use this at night and it keeps my face hydrated until morning. Very happy that I could sample (with points) two jars before deciding it’s fantastic. I see calmer skin, almost no redness (I have rosacea) and overall youthful appearance.\n",
      "…read more This is a game changer! I was stuck using FRESH night time moisturizer to try and keep the dryness at bay in the winter on the PNW. I wanted to step away from fragrance and have tried unsuccessfully to find something that wouldn't agitate my acne prone/sensitive skin until now! This moisturizer is incredible. My skin isn't dry anymore (which I never thought possible) and looking so dewy and clear! Best moisturizer I've ever used. Worth the money!\n",
      "…read more I love this cream. Very thick and moisturizing. A little goes a long way. I notice a real difference in my skin when I consistently use this everyday. The scent isn’t great, but it doesn’t bother me. AMAZING. My skin has never looked better - it is so soft, and very hydrating. I had dry spots on my face that have completely disappeared! AMAZING!!! I live in Colorado and this winter has been brutal on my skin. I’m sensitive/dry/red and this is doing a wonderful job of evening out skin tone with a great amount of hydration and NO BREAK OUTS!!!! Even my husband is stealing this from me, if you are thinking about it go for it. The price is worth it! My complexion is evening out so much! Honestly I love this product so much I cant wait to see what more progress my skin makes as time goes on using this! The smell is amazing and soft. You won’t notice it once you put it on your face. But the oil itself is AMAZING. It sinks in really fast, leaves your skin soft, and won’t break you out. My skin actually got less oily and way more even since using this. I’d go as far to say that my skin type is now more normal than combination. Amazing. The smell is horrible. And it took a while for me to be able to tolerate the smell. However, once you can get past the horrible lavender smell this stuff is a miracle oil. Everyone I know has raved about this product for years, and I received a free sample and I figured I would try it out, and I liked the results from the week the sample lasted so I decided to invest in a whole bottle of it. I have been using it for around 3 months now! I have an almost natural redness to my skin that I have always associated with having very sensitive skin. Like washing my face with just water will make my face red. Even with like the gentle dermatologist recommended CeraVe face wash, my face is red for like 15 minutes afterwards. I have noticed with continued use of this MRC that my face is much less red and irritated by other products. I love that when I wake up my face is even toned and glow-y. My skin is very dry in the winter, and this has helped prevent and get rid of all of my dry patches. I am excited to try the Daily Reviving Concentrate since that smell is citrus so I will likely actually enjoy that smell! My only concern is that this will end up being a winter only product since my skin is so oily in the summer. But I am used to having different products in the summer months than I use for the winter months. The only other important thing I would as about this oil is that if you have any big blemishes coming out, just know this will make them come out much faster but also it will make their life much shorter which is definitely a plus.\n",

It evens out skin texture and color and soothes while not being oily or greasy. Love love love. This product is amazing! I never write reviews but this product does exactly what it says it does. I have dry, sensitive skin and my skin can look a bit dull in the winter but this has given me my glow back. I have also started using a couple other Kiehl’s products along with it and my skin is the best it’s been all winter. Don’t think just buy! When I first got started with my skincare, this was my first big purchase after doing research. My skin changed so quickly! My skin tone became more even, the texture smoothed, and my skin was baby butt soft. Also, the scent is so lovely and indulgent before bed. I randomly received this as a toss off from my bestie who didn’t like the oily feeling it gave her right after applying. We both buy a lot of skin care products and usually pass on things to the other if it doesn’t work for us because our skin types are completely opposite. So glad I actually gave this a go though because it completely changed the texture of my skin after about two weeks of nightly use. I’m obsessed with it and have since repurchased it in the large size. I stopped using it when trying a new product a few months back and quickly regretted the switch and realized what a difference this stuff truly makes to the overall condition of my skin. This product makes my skin brighter, clearer and incredibly soft. It has done wonders for the few facial scars I have as well. It is now without a doubt on my holy grail list.\n",

      "…read more I LOVE this product! I use it as a base for my makeup and a replacemetn for a foundation. It does a great job evening out my skin and keeps me matte all day. I'm in love. The best BB what I ever had, I already used it more then 3 years and so happy that I found it one day! Highly recommended ⭐️⭐️⭐️ This product has taken the place of three separate steps in my make up routine. I used to apply primer, liquid foundation, and a matte powder foundation. I found my skin was looking dry and cakey, so I decided to give this stuff a shot. I LOVE it! It goes on smooth and velvety and lasts all day. It is very buildable as well! Just a layer of this with a little bronzer and setting powder and I'm good to go! So thankful it's cut out some time from my morning routine!\n",
      "…read more I LOVE this BB primer. It’s a little price and the package is small but it feels and looks SO NICE on my skin. I’m using it in lieu of any foundation. It provides great natural coverage and a healthy glow. I got a compliment on my skin on the first day I wore it! Love it! Just know that if you are oily you may want a setting powder. I sometimes use it with my cover FX or on its own for days when I want something lighter. Love this stuff! I’ve been using the IT Matte CC for a while and like it, but it seemed to rub off on everything! Tried Tarte based on a friend’s recommendation and it did it disappoint. Mousse-like feel, very smooth, and surprisingly build-able coverage. Very very happy with this product!! Would definitely recommend to those who don’t need a heavy face of full coverage makeup. I’m 40 years old with combo skin and this doesn’t irritate or cause breakouts\n",
      "…read more This has been my go-to primer for 3 plus years now. Love that it has an SPF 30. Literally makes my skin feel like cashmere and helps cover up the excess redness I have in my cheeks. I wear this alone when I want to have a more natural look. So great- would highly recommend! One of the few beauty products that I continue to buy, year after year. Soft and silky, great coverage... I use this in place of foundation, as I have yet to find any foundation--any brand--that feels as nice as this, and naturally evens out my skin like this product does. I would cry buckets if Tarte ever stopped making it! My only suggestion would be that the tube can get messy... this would work much better as a pump.\n",
      "…read more I'm so happy that the high reviews were on point for me. I love this product and wear it every day. I love the matted look it gives me (I'm super-oily) and how it makes my skin look even. It's light enough for every day wear. The only suggestion I would make is to not use the online shade finder as it matched me with a color that's too dark. Go to a physical location and try a sample before you buy. Love this stuff, and I've been using it for four years now. Not too runny like some BB creams, not too heavy, this is perfect. Usually I wear this on its own and it's enough to cover my acne scars and smooth my complexion while still looking very natural. Also works well under foundation, and as a base for eye shadow. FYI, I always apply sunscreen with it even though there's SPF built in, because you'd have to really paint this on in order to get sufficient coverage.\n",
      "…read more I am 57, and I use this without anything else. It says it is a primer, but unless I'm going someplace special, all I need is this and basic makeup and I'm done. I've never used a product that is so easy to use and makes my face flawless and natural. I’ve been using this for years, it’s just enough coverage without looking over done. Like a magic eraser for your face, evens skin tone and adds a layer of SPF protection. If they ever discontinue it I don’t know what I’ll do with myself! wish it came in a lighter color but other than that perfect!!! This product is amazing - people who are saying this makes their skin shiny/oily. DUH. It’s a cream. Put it on, let it have 5 min to settle/oxidize like any other BB cream or foundation, then put powder on it. POWDER. Stop giving things bad reviews when you don’t understand how makeup products work. I have gone through about 3 of these. I love the Dewey finish and it doesn’t leave my dry skin looking patchy. My only qualm is with the packaging I have broken the cap on every single bottle cause it doesn’t really seem to stay on...still love it though This is my favorite for all-in-one skincare, moisturizer, foundation. Great coverage, long lasting, and it’s so easy to just put this on in the morning instead of moisturizer, spf, and makeup. I really like this product! It’s a bit pale to me, seems like it kind of has pink undertones so it doesn’t work that well if you want to build it up cause then it won’t match but I use a tiny dollop so it’s not noticeable. I like the way it goes on though and the fact that it has spf is a plus. Smooth and silky texture. I love how it feels like nothing is on your face but provides SPF coverage . No scent This is by far my favorite foundation. I feel like I’ve tried everything, but I keep returning to my BB. The coverage is not heavy. It smoothies and evens everything out beautifully. I have large pores and foundations and other BB or CC creams seem to sink in to them making it very clear that I’m wearing makeup. This stuff hovers above my skin like a blurring veil. I’ll never stray again, BB. This formula is absolutely incredible. Perfect for \"no makeup\" days and can also use for a full face if my skin is in good shape. It has pretty decent coverage but is totally undetectable. It looks super natural and glowy on the skin. Also love the high amount of SPF. I would be very sad if this ever got discontinued. bb creams have changed my life. I'm blessed with naturally good skin, and for years I would wear these heavy pigmented foundations without realizing that a much lighter bb cream would suffice. I love the natural look that this beauty balm gives my skin and also protects from UV rays! never going back to the heavy stuff if I can help it - tho time may prove otherwise, lol! I am such a big fan of Peter Thomas Roth. This cream is wonderful!! I use it right before I put on my makeup, just to add one more step of moisture (I am a flight attendant so I need all the moisture I can get!). The jar it comes in feels really nice, the product last a long time!! I mean a long time! A little goes a long way. I scoop it out and put in a smaller jar to throw in my makeup case, it goes everywhere with me.\n",
      "…read more I tried this at Christmastime when I purchased a seasonal pack that came with masks and this cream. I was looking for a new moisturizer. I also bought Charlotte Tilbury’s magic cream to try after. Hands down, this is better. My makeup went on perfect, stayed on all day with or without a primer. It looked flawless on my skin and I use airbrush foundation. With the magic cream, with or without primer, my makeup is blotchy, looks thick and doesn’t look greasy, but feels greasy to the touch. Weird, yes, but I’ve had enough and I’m going back to this. I wanted to try the magic cream and wish I had stopped with this since it was so good, but I had to see what the rage for the magic cream was all about. Double the price compared to this and awful.

Always makes my skin so stable and glow! I love this product!! It literally is a cloud on your face and makes you feel amazing! I highly suggest grabbing this product!! I struggled a lot to find the best moisturizer fir my acne skin.. this one is the best.. now my acne has gone.. this is amazing .. its oil free and very light for the skin.. thanks sephora for recommending this to me Absolute holy grail skincare product. I will continue to repurchase this when i eventually run out... I’m 30 years old and while I still don’t have any wrinkles, I noticed my laugh lines crease was becoming more predominant. A friend swear by the essence water and while I still think the price is a little steep, I decided to give it a try. It’s been a month now and I noticed my lines are less viable than before! I use the essence on my regular morning and night routines. Love love love the Essence! Cannot do my skincare routine without it. It has become irreplaceable! It immediately hydrates and softens skin and you can feel your serums and creams absorb much better! A must have! This is my favorite Tatcha product. I will ALWAYS recommend it. Great at plumping and softening the skin. Sometimes when I use it at night, it’s all I need and I can skip a nighttime moisturizer. Leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft and if you want to let your skin breathe and not feel clogged than this is perfect for that. I literally wake up with baby face skin in the morning after using this product. I am on my second bottle of this Essence. I love the way it makes your skin feel after washing, very soft and moisturized! I cannot believe it took me so long to find the perfect skincare item. This essence has dramatically changed my skin for the better in just one night. Mind you, I have normal to combination skin and have never had any skin problems, so this essence might not deliver the same results for people with different skin types/conditions. This essence plumped my skin up so beautifully it’s unreal... my skin has never felt more soft before. This also ridded me of my pores on my cheeks in about two nights, and has diminished pores on my nose within a week. My trick for the best results is to pour a few drops onto damp palms and then apply to a damp face. I tried with dry hands and dry skin but it felt a bit sticky and didn’t apply as smoothly and evenly as it does with damp skin, and you end up using more product. I start out by gently tapping product over my face and finish off by rubbing in circular motions all over until absorbed. This is the #1 product I would recommend to anyone, even for the price it’s beyond worth it. I’ve been trying to find a product to get rid of pores and this is THE thing to try if you’re looking for the same thing. I swear by Tatcha.\n",
      "…read more This product is great for making whatever you put on top of it sink in better. I have dry skin and sometimes moisturizers/serums will just sit on top of my skin. With this, they really sink in & provide the hydration I need. The product feels refreshing when applied and instantly plumps my skin. My advice is to press the product into your skin (instead of rubbing it on) and not to wait too long before applying the rest of your skin care. Of course, wait until the essence is absorbed but a little damp.\n",
      "…read more I’ve tried lots of higher end essences and this is the one I always keep going back too. It keeps my skin soft and absorbs quickly. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. If you’re looking for a luxury essence, I would try this one out! This is legit, I use this essence after using a toner lotion that I bought in Japan and its a drugstore product. This essence helps to give softness and hydration for oily combination skin specially in winter season. I purchased this over the Christmas holidays on sale on the Tatcha website and I’m sold! I’m 47 and I’m struggling with staying hydrated in the winter season I have seen a huge difference in the hydration of my skin by adding this. I do use in combination the bit c serum, water cream or the dewy skin moisturizer ! Love this product! I read the expert review by kajaysenay. I appreciate having explanations on how to use an expensive product and that was great. At any rate, this essence is just what I was afraid of. GREAT. I can see a difference in my skin after using it only a couple of weeks. Fewer lines and wrinkles, skin seems brighter and dewy. All the things an over 60, or anyone wants. My skin type is combo with cystic acne. This product makes my skin feel so nice. It’s super hydrating and plumping. It also calms my redness. It has definitely become a holy grail that I’ll be purchasing forever. I love it! It feels very nice and makes my skin look good I get incredibly dry skin due to all of my acne treatments and wanted something that hydrated but didn’t clog pores. I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and am in love! Doesn’t turn my face into an oily mess by 2pm and truly moisturizes. Feels great going on and has been standing up to Montana cold! 10/10 in my book. Excellent! It’s the perfect everyday moisturizer. I use it alone, and over/under makeup. It’s not greasy or sticky, and there’s so much product for what a great price too! I normally don't write reviews, but I feel compelled to do so. This stuff really works. Moisturizing, but not greasy, which is great for my oily/combo skin. I love it. This moisturizer is great. It’s very lightweight yet still moisturizes very well. I love that it’s not thick or heavy. It’s much better than the dramatically different moisturizing lotion, which I did not like. I use this multiple times per day. I love this moisturizer. I got it as a sample and then bought a bigger one. The sample lasted forever because you only need a little bit. I’ve tried many moisturizers and this is my favorite. Doesn’t leave me feeling oily but also doesn’t make me feel dry as well and i appreciate that about this product. Clinique did a great job. Going to be hard for me to try another moisturizer. Perfect for my combination skin. It gives me just enough moisture without making me shiny mid day. I keep this stocked at all times. This gel comes from HEAVEN!!! Super lightweight and moisturizing — doesn’t make me breakout at all! Both my mum and I’s go-to moisturizer and super great in the travel sized mini for trips :) Always have loved Clinique products. This one I love because it’s not too heavy or make my face oily. Will definitely buy again! It’s the perfect amount of moisture, and the gel formula is amazing for giving moisture without feeling greasy. I use this on my face, excess on my hands, and even my kids’ faces after baths. Works perfectly under primer and foundation. My sensitive skin was ok with it, and I found it works well with other face lotion product. This is perfect for combo skin! Repurchased it a couple time’s and I keep going back to it. It’s hydrating without being too heavy and looks great under makeup This is the best moisturizer for combination or oily skin I have ever tried. I recommend it to all those who want a soft skin for many hours during the day. I finally found my holy grail! I have some adult hormonal cystic acne along my jaw line, some acne right in the middle of my forehead (-_-) and dry cheeks. It was a hot mess. This has fixed all of it. I cant even believe how good my skin is looking. And it lasts forever! I got a free 0.25oz sample first before fully commiting, and that lasted almost 3 weeks. I'm amazed, I thrilled, if you're approaching 30 and all of a sudden have crazy skin, give this a shot!\n",

So I finally made it to a Sephora because I don’t like ordering online and got a bottle and it’s only been a week but my 30 year old skin looks 22 again. I am writing this review because I happened to look at myself in the mirror just now and noticed my wrinkles or fine lines are gone my skin looks plump and healthy, I feel a lot less congestion under my skin but the popcorn—errr, pimples are all but gone.

Ok I WISH someone had told me about this product sooner. I have suffered with really annoying chin acne for several years now and used to break out with additional weekly scattered pimples that used to drive me nuts - I have completely changed my routine to make this my moisturizer morning and night (sometimes mid day too if dry) and I use Burts Bees make up wipes and a Mario Badescu face cleanser/toner - that is it! My skin has completely cleared up - COMPLETELY! I was so scared of this product because of it being an oil and the price, but I would literally bathe in this stuff if I could - can not say more positives about this. My skin is clear, smooth, soft, and it gives your skin a nice dewy look for a bit when its first on. This stuff transformed my skin!\n",
      "…read more Absolutely love it - for normal, not oily and not too dry skin i use this to seal in any moisturizer, on my hands especially. i use a tiny bit around my eyes to seal in the eye cream. i like it, im 33 and its helping. So I am 31, with dry skin especially around my nose and around my mouth. This is the only pure product that can soothe my skin. I use it under my makeup. I usually apply this to my face, neck, and chest area as soon as I get out the shower or after washing my face. 5-6 drops is enough. I’ve tried moisturizers coding $150 that couldn't hydrate my skin as well as this does, and was definitely not natural. I’m going to keep using this until it stops working for me, it’s been over a year and it’s still working perfectly for me.\n",
      "…read more I have been using this face oil for 4 years now. So far have not found a better product to replace this. I love this stuff! It's really helped to heal my dry skin especially with the Winter months and I put it all over my body including my face. I find it lightweight and not heavy for my face. I have combination skin and I usually pat it on my face after I've put moisturizer on. Makes my skin soft the next day. This product is absolutely amazing. I am 46 years old and startes noticing severe deep wrinkles on my neck/decolletage and loose sagging skin on my neck. It was starting to bother me so much I started researching cosmetic surgeries. I've always been told I look 30s but my neck was starting to look 70. I sleep on my side and large breasts which caused very deep lines across my chest. I was embarrassed to wear v neck tops. Within one week of using Perricone Sub D Neck I could see dramatic improvement. 3 weeks later and the lines on my chest are gone. My neck skin is firm and no longer crepey. I apply it along my chin and jawline as well and this area is firm and much more defined. The price is out of my budget but with these results I will cut costs somewhere else to continue having this in my life. I see many people complaining about the smell. IMO it 1st smells like a clean pleasant light citrus scent. After a few moments it does develop a somewhat fishy smell. But it isn't bad. I don't tolerate bad smells well. It's more of a fresh uncooked fish smell rather than a nasty fish odor. I just think of the smell as a positive that it is doing amazing work while I sleep! Worth every penny.\n",
      "…read more This stuff smells fine. Not perfumy but certainly not fish. I'd say if anything food-like it reminds me a bit of a lemon vinaigrette. And that's the way it smelled to me 4 or 5 years ago too. Has nothing to do with a formula being changed. Just how my nose works. I wonder if the fish smell is something genetic... kinda like the way some people taste soap when they eat cilantro. I am in my 50's I got a small size in a random product sampler, so I tried it. I very small bottle lasted 30 days. Even my husband noticed that my neck looked tighter. I have to tell you I have never had a product work like this before. Is there a smell? Yes, it is not awful and goes away in about 10 min. I was starting to notice my neck looking like chicken skin. I used my body lotion to moisturize everyday but it was not doing the trick. I tried Cold Plasma and everyday my neck was looking better and better. Now I'm hooked! It looks moisturized and smooth. Some have complained about the smell. I find that it has a mild smell of clay but I never notice it on me, just when I'm putting it on. It is not an offensive odor.\n",
      "…read more I really love this stuff! Makes my makeup look a bit more hydrated after setting with powder! Amazing dewy finish that actually lasts for hours. Real glass skin look. Love it! I spritz this all over my face once I’m finished with all my makeup I order this repeatedly.... love the way it makes my skin look so dewey without being overly shiny. I love this stuff. I have really dry skin and this makes me look like I don’t. If you need a glow or to look a little more hydrated, this is what you need. I sprat this baby on my skin once my Urbay Decay all-nighter is dry. So my make up stays put and Tatcha gives me that final crucial touch, that healthy dew look. LOVE! This mist is actually a very light oil in a fine mist spray. It’s in a durable glass bottle, so I keep this in my purse at ALL times. I work in an office that has the AC blasting all day, bright fluorescent lights and I’m staring at a computer screen for 8 hours straight. My skin starts to feel dry and gets a little blotchy around 10am and basically my skin never looks good when exposed to all of those factors. I got a full size of this product in one of the Christmas bundles (2018) and I have to say- it works. Within 10 minutes of spraying, my skin is plump, dewy and it glows. It’s a fantastic makeup refresher too. It makes my pores look smoother and my makeup look like my skin. It also hydrates around the eyes which is huge for me, because they get so dry from blue light. Lasts me about 6 months.\n",
      "…read more I am in love with this mist. I bought a few Tatcha products in the smaller sizes to try them out, and I love them! I will be buying them all in the full sizes. I use this mist before and after my moisturizer. It gives the perfect dewy look and feels so moisturizing. It doesn’t seem like much is coming out of the bottle because the spritz is so light so I have gone through it so quickly that really only 3 pumps is enough. I use urban decay as my finishing spray to lock in makeup. This seems more like a hydrating product which gives my skin the perfect glow. Works great with the Tatcha Dewy Moisturizing Cream. I have tried a lot of high end products and this line has become one of my favourites.\n",

I have been looking for a product I can apply OVER makeup to add back a healthy glow, and this skin mist does exactly that! It adds a perfect dewy glow to my skin that lasts all day long, while keeping my makeup intact. Literally every time I use it, I get comments about how healthy and radiant my skin looks. I highly recommend this product!\n",

My face cleared up in days and it has the softest application. My go to. I have dry and sensitive skin and this stuff leaves me feeling incredible. I've been looking for a moisturizer that: doesn't make me shimmer after application or enhances the oil on my skin after taking 5 steps.. Absorbs really well as a combination skin type, I'll say it's a really suitable for me during winter and also summer. It dose moisture my face but not oily, it absorbs well after applied. A nice neutral moisturizer with a light scent. In the summer I use Olehenriksen Oil Control (the green one) to keep my skin more matte but this one is nice for the winter. I have tried so many face creams for my extremely acne prone skin and always come back to this one. It’s been more gentle than Tatcha’s water cream but more hydrating than Fresh’s deep moisture rose cream. One of my Never Run Outs! I have been using this face cream for over a year now and it’s a staple to my skin care regimen. I also use other olehenriksen products inlcludinv their Vitamim C Serum and eye cream. Their products are great quality and truly deliver results. I love using this lotion under my makeup and feels lightweight under my tinted moisturizer. Recently I have only been wearing alone without any tinted moisturizer and I love how it makes my skin love and feel. My skin tone, texture has perfected over time fr using these products along with my monthly facials. It’s lightweight and does not irritate my skin. I have somewhat combination skin, Oily T-Zone and sometimes dry on my cheeks. At the end of the day I always tend to look a little shiny. The jar will last me quite a while, a little goes a long way. I also love their travel size version. I can take one with me for 10 day vacation and it will last the whole trip.\n",

I was breaking out horribly until a Sephora worker recommended this to me, now my skin is so good! Cream takes time to show results. Would purchase again. Very nice light cream. Absorbs right away. My skin was getting very dry from the winter air and this helped right away. I bought this after reading and hearing a lot of good reviews.

I have very pale sensitive skin and I love to layer this under Tarth BB cream. Love this moisturizer! It adds a subtle glow and smells amazing! It’s a great glow moisturizer with perfect look of no makeup look or can be use as a makeup base to to put a dewy finish to ur makeup. This is my second bottle, I use it on daily basis and I’m loving it I absolutely love this foundation. Makes my mature skin look flawless. I was looking for light coverage that didnt sink into pores or fine lines. This is perfection. Light coverage that I can build upon, but leaves a natural look. And it goes on well with the pad provided, no need for sponges or brushes. Love the light coverage and great sun protection. I use this every day and live in CA. After using it I haven’t had any trouble with sun burns on my fair skin I can only say that this is amazing. I’ve never had such an easy to apply, beautiful finish, close color match, or amazing sun protection all in one convenient compact. There’s no need for brushes or beauty blenders and it looks so much better than any of my half dozen other foundations! And it absolutely doesn’t budge all day long. I will only need this from now on! Thank you so much for creating this miracle product.\n",

Lightweight and beautiful coverage. This stuff is amazing. I'm not a huge fan of foundation; I don't like my face to feel caked with \"stuff\" on it. I do however, like my color to be even and pores to be invisible. Over the years, I've used tinted sunscreens and moisturizers but still wasn't fond of that \"makeup feeling.\" A sephora manager told me about this product. I was reluctant, because it reminded me of high school days, plowing pancake foundations and powders throughout the day. That was awful! This stuff is AMAZING. I feel like I'm putting a moisturizer on my face or a light mask. It lasts nearly all day long, depending on how active I am. I never need to touch up more than once a day, if at all. The sunscreen coverage is great also. I freckle easily, but this is seriously great sunscreen. Feels amazing, improves my highly sensitive skin, covers large pores and imperfections, and looks beautiful. I hope they make this forever!!!\n",

Great to use after moisturizer! Leaves skin glowing but not oily. Love this lightweight oil. Has done wonders on my very dry, MN winter skin. This has become a staple in my skin routine in very short order. I will buy this again and agIn! Even though the product has fragrance in it, it’s the last ingredient, so I wouldn’t really bother much. (Natural fragrance doesn’t provide benefit for skin and can have some downsides too!) Apart from that, I believe this is one of the best oils in the market according to the ingredient list (and I have looked from normal brand to hi-end brand). I’ve finished two or three bottles so far, best I’ve ever used. Lasts a long time. *** I’ve read that flax is not that stable, and I ordered this oil from ebay once and it came in a slightly darker color than the bottle I got from sephora. That might be oxidization that you might have to be concerned. (I’m sure the label is slightly different from the sephora bottle, must have come from older production) So I guess one thing to keep in my is use it consistently when you buy it.\n",

I have very acne prone skin and I use this every morning and night and Its never clogged my pores. I got this in the Sephora 12 days of Skincare set, and it’s going to be the only one out of the whole set that I buy the full size of. This oil is so nice! It gives my skin the prettiest glow without clogging my pores or making me feel greasy.

I've always been a little skeptical of oils since the ones I've tried in the past haven't really worked out, but after about 2 weeks of using this, I actually see a difference in my face! I have a moderately oily T zone and very dry cheeks and this oil has definitely done a great job of balancing that. I especially see a difference in my complexion, which has been HUGE for me.

I don’t find the smell that strong. When first out of the package yes but it doesn’t last. This is my go-to product for dealing with rosacea flares, especially in cold weather. A little goes a long way. But this recovery balm does what it claims for my sensitive skin. I use it only when my face is feeling irritated and is dry (esp winter) so basically, I am using this about 2-3 times a week and I really adore it. Also whenever I start to get a couple of annoying bumps or pimples (cuz you know sensitive skin) I use this the night of and by the morning the pimples start to go down.

Typically, during the winter my face tends to feel very dry and this has definitely helped my skin feel moisturized. A little goes a long way, and it smells great! This feels like butter on the face and hydrates really well. Usually at night i will add a layer of this on top of my moisturizer and serums as a last step but during the day I find it a little too greasy looking so I mix a tiny amount in with my daytime moisturizer and it keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day! I've struggled with cystic acne since I was a teenager. Nothing from a dermatologist or any store would help. Once a break out would happen I'd have to wait 2 weeks for the painful mounds to clear. Not anymore! This stuff is like magic for my skin. Normally I like to use this 1-2 times a week to keep my skin feeling smooth and happy.

I'm a huge fan of the entire evercalm line, so I had pretty high expectations for this, and it did not disappoint! It's very rich, so you only need a little per use (which is good since $48 is pricey) and I find it to be incredibly effective after only one or two nights. My skin is normal/dry, more so in the winter, so this is perfect for when I need to replenish ASAP. It's also fantastic at calming any irritation, so I use it both as a night treatment and/or for spots/areas. I was worried that the balm would be too much on top of moisturizer, but it's not greasy at all! Probably wouldn't use it as much in the summer unless I need to treat irritation, since even though it's not heavy, I think it would be too much, so I also wouldn't necessarily recommend it to those with oily skin- I've never had an issue with it causing congestion, but I'm not acne-prone, so I can't say for sure.

I’m also using their black tea essential water that’s good too. I will be 69 in November and have been using the Corset Cream and the Rose Moisturizing Cream for a few years. I highly recommend both. After living near beaches from my 20s through 42, I am more concerned about skin care than cosmetics and use an SPF sunscreen daily. The Corset Moisturizer has a mild fragrance, a luxurious creaminess, and a lovely finish. It is compatible with sunscreens and foundations. My jawline, parentheses and neck wrinkles are more firm than when I started the product. And my skin is nicely moisturized even in the Colorado aridity. I do not look close to 70! The Rose Moisturizer is a lovely alternative some days. It smells lightly like an English garden and 'plumps' my skin as though I am in a place with actual humidity! If you are aging without facial surgery, these two moisturizers and related products will certainly keep your skin looking and feeling elegant.

It works sooooo great I really like this face cream. Keeps my skin hydrated all day without feeling slick. It's expensive but worth it. Smells like tea. Smooth and hydrating. Great for my winter dry skin. I used this a few times and immediately began to notice results. I noticed that my skin was becoming duller due to long nights and lack of sleep. I feel like all of that went away just by adding this moisturizer to my routine. I just started using a skin care routine, and I use mostly ole henriksen stuff.

I bought this 1.5-2 years ago with a gift card I received for my birthday or something after doing A LOT of research (I bought the 3 pack actually) and used it all until it was empty, loved the way my skin looked! I have since then repurchased the 3 pack a couple more times (dying inside every time as it’s $100-but thankfully it lasts a couple months at a time) this time I bought strictly this night time treatment and let me tell you this is the star of that whole set!! I notice a difference the first morning after I used it! My skin looks brighter and happier and evened out!!! I find I break out A LOT less and it’s just an overall amazing product! I apply this every night and if I remember correctly the bottle lasts a couple months. It can pill, but I find it doesn’t if you let it dry before applying moisturizer. I’m not a huge makeup wearer, and when I do i prefer sheer and glowy products, so this helps my skin look the best it can so my sheer products look flawless!

Great moisturizer! Live this cream and used the whole jar. I use some Murad products so bought this when looking for something with Hyaluronic Acid. Love that the cream is very lightweight but yet very effective. It evened out my skin tone and lightened some skin spots from the sun. Will definitely buy again. Not oily or overly moisturizing, just the perfect amount.. skin feels sooo nice. I have oily skin and haven’t noticed a problem with this. I’m using a trial of this now and I would buy it but.. I can get other nice moisturizers much much cheaper. Conbination skin must have!!!Super love it in spring and summer!! Can’t leave without it in my rest of life! This moisture is good for dry skin I loved high price but it’s really work Love this as a daytime moisturizer! It leaves my face super moisturized without being heavy or oily. I have combination skin, and typically reserve ultra hydrating products for my nighttime routine, but found this left just the right amount of moistuization to use before makeup application. My cheeks are supple AND my forehead isn't an oil slick at the end of the day. Will definitely repurchase! Perfect for the winter. Very absorbing. Very hydrating! I have combination skin, my forehead and nose tend to get pretty oily. Most moisturizers only make it worse but this one doesn’t. A little goes a long way. I purchased because it was on sale and the reviews were great. So glad I did! AMAZING I’m just finishing up my third jar. 1000% buying again. It makes my skin feel so moisturized. I put it on very night and let it soak in while I sleep <333 I’m not one for writing reviews but this lotion deserves one. I have very dry, acne prone skin. This (in combination with the herbivore Phoenix oil) lives my skin hydrated, soft and smooth. I’ve tried so many moisturizers and this is by far the best. Will continue to use. I’m super picky about moisturizers and this one is suitable for my standards. It’s fairly basic and doesn’t wow me, but it has a smooth whipped texture and quenches skin naturally, without the use of dimethicone or petrolatum which is rare even for the clean moisturizers at Sephora. The rose scent is extremely faint. I loved that there was a sheet provided that explained the benefits of their ingredients and explained why they choose not to include certain ingredients. Overall a very simple and good moisturizer!\n",

THIS is the moisturizer I've been looking for all my life. I have such dry skin and I could hear my pores singing little \"thank you's\"! To be clear, this is definitely a night time moisturizer. It's way too heavy to go well under make up even with my dry skin. I use it with their Phoenix oil and their Rose\n",
      "…read more I've been shopping around for moisturizers and have found this to be one of my favorites that I've tried. I live in a high desert climate so it's particularly difficult to keep my skin moist, but this does it, and I daresay makes it glow. Very happy with this cream. A great moisturizer for dry skin. The small spoon allows you to use a little at a time, but a little goes a long way. Lasted me for months. I absolutely love this moisturizer! It hydrates my skin Love love love this moisturizer! I’ve never gotten so many compliments on my skin. It just glows! Switched from Fresh's lotus complex 7 (which I loved) because they aren't cruelty-free. I didn't miss a beat with Pink Cloud, it is full of antioxidants that I feel when I apply(like a slight hot burn) which was why I liked Fresh. Scent is of roses...love it! I love it. It’s lightweight, leaves my skin feeling hydrated. It feels like my skin took a chug of water. I love this travel size of CT Magic Cream . The best moisturizer and primer for foundation !! I have wanted to try this product ever since I learned about Charlotte Tilbury's company magic cream is truly magic. this lasted a 7 day vacation and came home with the jar not empty. when you want to treat yourself, go charlotte tilbury. even the packing is fabulous. Loving how rich, smooth, and creamy the texture of this cream feels. The nice texture made it easier to blend into my skin. It doesn’t leave a greasy residue at all. It’s thick, so you don’t have to use much. It soaks in real well, so it doesn’t interfere with my foundation and I love the hydration I couldn't love this cream more! All I can say is it makes my skin feel so happy and balanced. Initially I thought it would be thick based on how it comes out of the jar, but it absorbs into skin within minutes. I wear it morning and night. It serves as a perfect base to prime my face for makeup. I've always had issues with hormonal breakouts, and while I won't credit this cream with fixing everything (I think its been a combination of products) this has definitely helped. I really believe it balances and calms my skin. It makes it look radiant and feel great. I've been using it for about a month straight now and have noticed my skin become more even toned and hasn't broken out at all!\n",
      "…read more This cream is amazing. Tightens my face and makes me look younger. Its not oily so it gives you an immediate freshened look without looking shiny. It’s amazing. I’ve been using for 1month and see the difference. I shared this with La Mer as well; they deserve full credit. I have a scar near the right corner of my upper lip, the result of an assault when I was 17. I took a blow across the mouth that opened a gash right through the full thickness of my lip, and I’ve lived with it for over 40 years. About two months ago, I picked up a jar of Gel de La Mer from Sephora (tyvm VIB Rouge!), and have been using it as directed every day. Not only is my face smooth and hydrated, the scar is now softer, smoother, much lighter, and much less noticeable. I’m happy to show before/after pics to give you an idea of the difference this product has made: the pic of me in the gray sweater is from 12/11/2017, the one in the black fleece was taken 1/13/2020.\n",

I had a reaction to a face mask one night and my rosacea flared up and started burning, I applied this several times and the reaction went down almost immediately. I’m also acne prone and the gel version has never caused me to breakout. I don’t like the prices of the La Mer products or how strong their fragrance is, but it has been a lifesaver for me many times. I’d recommend trying it or getting samples first if you can just because of the price and everyone’s skin is unique.\n",

Amazing product! Best cream to use if you have acne prone skin. Not heavy but still moisturizes! I really like this texture and it’s very hydrating. There is probably an equally good product out there though but if you have the money get this! If you have oily/acne prone skin，you might wanna give it a try. I use it at night as a night time moisturizer, it really helps keep my skin hydrated while not being too oily. It does not break me out either. This is by far my favorite gel cream. Will repurchase! I had been using the old gel and was worried buying the new one (last year) due to the reviews. This does not give any cooling effect which is good and hydrates me just the same - i am happy but there was no need to change it I had avoided getting this because of the negative reviews until I went to a La Mer counter and tried it for myself. I am so glad that I did! I love it as much as my Tatcha Water Cream and Belif Aqua Bomb. These are the moisturizers I keep buying for daily use. I have oily skin, I swear you could fry an egg using all the oil I could produce! Lol. But seriously, remember people everyone is different! Just because it doesn’t work for somebody, doesnt mean it will be an epic failure for you too!\n",
      "…read more There are a few products that I cannot be without, and this moisturizer is one of them. I received a deluxe sample of this and my oily/sensitive skin has never looked better. I have been using this product for almost a year, and love how it gives my skin that fresh dewy appearance that I’m after, without causing breakouts. The price tag is steep, but a jlo glow makes it worth it for me. ;) I dont understand the low ratings for this moisturizer. It is absolutely amazing. It has made my skin extremely soft and hydrated without feeling oily or sticky. I have combination acne prone skin and so far this has not made me break out. Also, sephora should be giving out samples for La mer, instead of customers buying and returning. This is one La mer item I will be buying consistently. Try it out! This is the very best daily moisturizer I’ve ever used, and I’ve tried so very many. I actually quit using this about 2 years ago because it was expensive, but recently, I picked it up again. I was looking at older photos, noticed how much better my skin looked in them, and decided I needed to go back to using this product. Within three days of use, I started getting compliments on my complexion again! I will never stop using this again. It leaves my skin glowing, moisturized, and soft.\n",
      "…read more Feeling so rejuvenated when I apply this! And I know it does miracles, I always get compliments on looking youthful. Totally recommend! I loved this so much! It was light and fluffy and hasd sunscreen! I love this moisturizer for the day time. It is super hydrating on my skin, has SPF in it, and smells really luxurious. I notice immediate hydration and from daily use, my skin has looked a lot more radiant, moisturized, and smooth. This is pretty pricey but I cannot part w/it. I tried other sunscreen products but nothing compares to the quality and moistness this product gives me. When I tried to be frugal, it backfired on me. My chin dried out and it showed when I wore foundation. Since returning to this product and using for 2 weeks consistently my face has returned back to normal. No white cast whatsoever. My skin is well hydrated. Definitely a repurchase and can’t live w/o product for me.\n",

Would purchase again Works great on my oily skin, moisturizes without adding too much shine. Great cream with SPF----wouldn't be without it.... I absolutely love this moisturizer! The scent is refreshing without being overpowering, it hydrates super well and also creates a nice base for makeup. A little goes a long way with this product! I love messing around with skin products since my only concern is seasonal dryness, and this moisturizer makes me feel softer than I ever have before. The smell isn’t too strong; it makes me feel clean at night and awake in the morning. It’s totally worth any price. I usually switch up moisturizers, but I know I’ll be returning back to this one. I’ve gone through about 5 of these now, obviously a daily essential and excellent product. Helps balance combination skin and lightens acne scars. My second bottle. Smells good and moisture well. It's more watery than creamy. Really nourishing my half-dry-half-oily skin for fall and winter days. The smell is lovely and the feel of the product on your skin will give you mother nature status skin hydration. The smell is so GOOD. like nectar and a fresh garden. It goes on so nice, it makes me look so hydrated. love this buying it again I loveeee this product. It’s my second time purchasing it, the smell is amazing and the texture is not too heavenly not light. Perfect for oily skin. I love this moisturizer, it definitely does the job of hydrating my face without leaving me oily or making my acne prone skin any worse. I use it every morning even under primer and foundation. Love, love, love! Soothes your skin and smells glorious! Was excited to try this because I love the glow water! This did not disappoint. Leaves the skin feeling moisturized and glowing! I have very sensitive skin and am always very hesitant to switch moisturizers since they stay on all night long and lock in my other face products. But after using this moisturizer I am so glad I found it! I used to switch moisturizers in the summer and winter But find that I can use this no matter the season because it is light enough for the summer and just enough for the winter. I use this under my makeup and overnight and am so happy with how my skin feels immediately afterwards and in the morning. It goes on beautifully. I also love that there is not an obnoxious smell!\n",
      "…read more This is an excellent product. My skin is a combination kind of and I have been using this product for the last 5 months and still, It has some left. It helps to glow the skin, to repair, reduce visible spots it. I bought another one. I recommend this product. I use it after my base makeup to melt it all together. It holds it in place well and blends the cream and powder I purchased the mini travel size of the Photo Finish Primer Water impulsively as I’d been out of setting spray and meaning to go to MAC for Fix + instead. However, after trying this as well as the other new setting spray by Smashbox - I have yet to purchase any other setting sprays! This product is worth trying because, in my opinion, seems to actually DO what it claims and serves many more important purposes beyond just feeling refreshing and smelling nice. This Primer Water I only used as a setting spray, so I can’t speak on how well it works as a primer used beneath foundation. I feel this “Primer Water” version is incredible specifically for locking in makeup, making it truly last all day while looking naturally radiant, dewy & freshly done. If you’re like me and need something SERIOUSLY “transfer-proof”, you may enjoy the Smashbox Photo Finish Setting Spray more. Especially for those who work physically intensive jobs and need their makeup to LAST throughout sometimes sweaty work shifts. That one is truly as transfer-proof as any form of makeup I’ve tried thus far. Especially considering I’m one to blend my foundation, powder, etc. into my neck — but unfortunately must wear black collared shirts for my job. Before trying the Smashbox Setting Spray, the inside of my shirt collar would be nearly white as snow (compared to the black shirt) within just minutes of putting it on. Although a few $ more than some other brands and smells, feels and appears to be nothing more than water — its MAGIC, I promise!\n",
      "…read more My ultimate multi purpose spray. I use it before and after putting on makeup. I also wet my beauty blender with it to blend out foundation. Helps create a nicely hydrated finish! I have super dry skin so I carry a mini around to touch up. I have repurchased this bottle 6 times so far in the last few years.... hoping they come out with a MEGA bottle so I can just refill my existing bottles with it! The best primer there is. It is so easy to apply and to use it as a setting spray as well! I have been using this product for over five years. It works. This is the only setting spray that I have found that does not make my eyes water (even though I close them tightly when I use any spray). Works great! I need to try it as a primer next. Love that it is cruelty free, too. I love this product! This was a huge upgrade from previous finishing sprays I’ve used before like NYX Dewy Finish and Mac’s Fix Plus. And was honestly hesitant to buy something higher than my usual price ranger for this type of product, but I couldn’t be happier with it; it is 100% an investment though. I also love that you can use it to prime and finish the look—because it is multipurpose, it makes the purchase of it definitely twice as much worth. It’s lasted me a long time, don’t need a lot of product to get a good outcome. Makes you level up your makeup game!!\n",

It’s doesn’t burn my skin and it feels simple, fresh and clean, and not full of chemicals like other face sprays. My makeup stayed on after a hot yoga sesh!\n",

This is my new go to setting spray, used it post primer, after liquid foundation and once I was completely done. Helped me stay matte and no transferring all day. I was looking for a new setting spray after I couldn't stand the Urban Decay setting spray smell any longer... and I found the perfect product!! Doesn't have a strong scent and I love spraying it all over my skin!! It's now a must-have in my makeup routine. Been using this for months now, the only downside to it is the price, but my skin got so used to it that I will continue buying it forever. As much as I try to replace it with Belif or Clinique, I end up coming back to this little guy I was looking a for a moisturizer for the winter time. I was using a lot of products that kept leaving me oily. This does NOT and I love it. Thanks Springfield Mall, VA for the recommendation. Perfect for adding hydration without feeling greasy! I have very sensitive but oily skin. In the winter, I can get some dry patches and my skin can look tired and lifeless. This does the trick without breaking me out, moisturizing those dry spots and its even helped to control some of the more oily areas. I love the way it has left my skin feeling fresh, plump and soft. I don't really mind the fragrance and it doesn't seem to make my skin freak out. I have been loving this cream.\n",

I actually returned Murad’s hydro-dynamic moisturizer after I received a sample of this and preferred it much more. I didn’t disliked the hydro-dynamic but it didn’t do much for me. This on the other hand was so moisturizing and went on so silky smooth. I felt a difference instantly. I continued to use the sample of this for about five days before deciding to return the hydro-dynamic and my skin was much softer after five days than before I started using it. I’m happy I got the full size in this one!\n",

I use this before bed and let me tell you, my skin looks and feels amazing in the morning! this stuff seriously saved my skin, i damaged my moisture barrier when i was trying to deal with my hormonal acne, leaving my skin super dehydrated, sensitive, and bumpy. I bought this and its helped cleared up SO much. I'd recommend as a night cream for oily/combo (that's how i use it) overall a great product and will be buying again. I am never letting go of this product. It claims to repair your barrier in 30m, which I thought was an over-exaggeration, but it’s almost immediate. Skin type: I have sensitive skin, dehydrated but not dry. lacks water and will overcompensate by creating oil. I live on things like Hyaluronic. Fav lines are usually SR, DE. Truth! I messed up my mantle with actives as the weather changed from warm to cold. So, everything I put on my face (even the normal stuff) felt like sunburn. I reduced my routine to moisturizer only. After days of this reduced routine, I went to Sephora to look for a fix. I tried a popular ceramide lotion and it felt like fire. We wiped it off with micellar water. Still on fire. THEN we put this on my face and I was immediately relieved. Every day since then has been more hydrated than the last. The cystic acne that was developing in response to my broken barrier is now gone. Bonus, my wrinkles look reduced and my skin has a nice healthy glow. No oil slick.\n",

I have really sensitive skin and problematic acne and extreme combination skin so this was surprising!!!!!! It’s a really nice moisturizer I’m not even sure how to explain but I love it Super oily skin friendly! Lightweight formula but it’s not a gel. It’s definitely lower on the scale for actually moisturizing (my preference for daytime) but it does moisturize sufficiently. I have slightly less oil production the days I use this which is why I really like it. A little product of this goes a long way.

I have fungal acne and this is the best moisturizer I have been using so far. This moisturizer has Urea which is one of a good ingredient to fight fungal acne. This is my second bottle so far. I received this moisturizer in a FabFitFun box last fall and was very skeptical of using it, but as soon as I started my skin cleared up so fast! Once the bottle ran out I tried to switch back to an organic, simple moisturizer but my skin was never the same. I purchased this moisturizer again two weeks ago (along with the Murad toner) and my skin has already cleared up so much and is so smooth. It also really balances my oily complexion, and reduces shine during the day.\n",
      "…read more I have been using this as a daily moisturizer for over a year and absolutely LOVE it! I love that it has no fragrance and never feels sticky. I get cystic pimples around my time of the month and my skin also tends to get very dry in the winter time -- this lotion has helped so much with these issues and I can't recommend it enough! When I first bought this it did nothing for me. I even tried to return it, but I had waited too long so I couldn’t. I tried it again, and realized I was using it wrong. I don’t find it works well under makeup, but at night it does. The key is to do a double wash and get all your makeup off, then this stuff can sink in and do it’s job. Since I have done hat my skin is glowing! I double wash with La Roche Posay, use this essence, the Estée Lauder Nigh Repair Serum, then IT cosmetics Secret Sauce... and wow. I finally have the skin I’ve been wanting! I’m 42 and have mature acne prone skin, but I’ve had almost zero zits since I started with this regimen.\n",

Great cream that feels luxurious on skin. I noticed dark spots lighter in first week. This is quite honestly the best moisturizer I’ve even used. I ran out of my old Clinique moisturizer and I wanted a change and omg I can’t get over how my skin feels. I went through a really dry patch before I got this ( live in Canada and the dry winters kill my skin) and the night I first used it my skin was already turning around. I know it’s pricey (I got it on the recent sale) but there is not doubt in my mind that I will re purchase this when I run out.\n",
      "…read more Loving this moisturizer! I have been using it for a few weeks now and I have noticed my skin looks much brighter and I have less dark spots. It is very light - not greasy and has a delicate smell. Quickly became my everyday moisturizer. The only moisturizer with spf I will use! This is my first review and I’ve been using this for over 2 years. It doesn’t leave your face shiny like most other moisturizers with spf. I change my skincare products a lot, but this one is a staple that never changes! Love this product. Does not go heavy on the skin and has a nice fragrance. Highly recommend this product!! It is the best oil-free moisturizer with SPF that I have found!! It is not greasy and it is easy to apply make up on top of this moisturizer. I was a little hesitant because of the price but this product lasts a long time. Give it a try!! Love this cream! I developed dark spots from the sun on my face and most recumbent neck. I’ve been using this cream for a month and have noticed the the spots are getting lighter. Need the SPF everyday! Wonderful moisturizer! This is such a gem product for the summer, love how light it feels and how well it absorbs! Perfect for combination skin. Have been using it for a few years now with the vitamin C serum and see a great difference in my skin. Cannot say how much I love this product! I have been using this product for a long time. I have rosacea, and my skin usually reacts to even the gentlest of products. For me, this is perfect: it doesn’t irritate my skin, it is non-oily, and it has an SPF. I also love its delicate hint-of-fruit scent. It took me a while to find my moisturizer, and I won’t use anything else. All time favorite moisturizer. I notice less breakouts with it and more balanced skin. This is a bomb product amazing This is a creamy, thick lotion that goes on smooth and soaks in quickly to allow you to apply make up over. I love this night cream! My skin is firmer and baby soft. A little goes a long way, I know it’s on the pricey side but it lasts a long time and does not break me out. So far Caudalie products have been good for my 41 yr old skin. I love this product! It moisturizes my skin so deeply without leaving it feeling oily or greasy, and in the morning my skin is still soft and moisturized. Love this product now that I’m entering my 40s and this feels like my skin has become firmer and less dull! Best night cream ever! It’s hydrating without feeling heavy. Leaves my skin refreshed and feeling good. The best night cream, goes on smooth and doesn’t feel heavy. I had been using a different “lift” night serum (Korres Black Pine 3-D.) I was disappointed in that product, so I turned to my favorite skin care brand, Caudalie. This cream is so cool, soothing yet tingly, and I’m already seeing some results after 3 weeks. It may be an expensive brand, but Caudalie NEVER fails to work. This lifting night cream is wonderful. Smoothing, tightening, moisturizing. My skin is over 50, but I don’t look it due mainly to Caudalie.\n",
      "…read more Love this! When I wake up in the morning my complexion is beautiful and personally, I love the smell. I have mature skin and actually feel product tightening my face. My favorite ! I was first introduce to Caudalie skin care line when I was given a sample. I'm 62 yrs old and many think I'm 40 due to my face is so smooth. I now used Caudalie as my skin care. Such a good night cream for winter, and summer. A fantastic night creme - it is very helpful for my neck as well as my face. A subtle scent for nighttime sweet dreams. I only use the night creme because it's stronger than the day version but this creme makes time go backwards! It's super rich but not in a heavy clogging your pores way, more like it sinks into your skin Love this line! Very creamy night replenisher ~ you see the difference in the morning ~ it sinks in perfectly I have been using this cream for about 2 months by now and I absolutely love it. I use it as a day cream at the moment because my skin gets very dry during the winter. It absorbs quickly without leaving an oily residue. It just feels good on my skin. I am very sensitive to harsh chemicals in my skincare and I am pretty sure that this product doesn't have any because I didn't have any allergic reaction so far. This was my first foray into oil cleansing and I'm in love. This oil removes all of my makeup mascara, rinses away clean and leaves my skin feeling super soft. I typically only use at night, so one bottle lasted me six months. Good cleansing oil. As a guy I only really use it to properly take several days of my SPF off. Gentle does cause a little cloudy vision the few times I’ve gotten it my eye. My sensitive combo skin prefers this over Green Clean which i found to strip my skin during double cleansing. Again I won’t use as much as someone with make up but should last 4 months at least with daily use. I LOVE this brand – that it's clean, what it stands for, and how it sources its ingredients. I tried this on a gut feeling after a different brand cleansing remover didn't work out as I'd hoped. The true test would be if it would be effective on my waterproof mascara. I often use the pads of my fingers to apply cleansing oil, and all my eye makeup – primer, shadow, waterproof gel eyeliner, and most of my waterproof mascara, went off within the first swipe! Passing the pads of my fingers over my lashline twice over, after that, and the rest of the mascara was gone! It was so quick and effective, the rest could be used to cleanse the rest of my face. So, it turns out I don't need much per makeup removal, very economical. Wash off with water, clean as a whistle! I double cleanse, but I could've been good as is. Second thing I was concerned about was breaking out afterwards, since my skin is HIGHLY sensitive and prone to breaking out. ZERO breakouts. I found my Holy Grail cleansing oil!\n",

I originally fell in love with the dermalogica precleanse, but wanted something clean and had a better price/ounce. I found this and it works just as good if not better. So gentle but removes all makeup. AMAZING PRODUCT!! So earlier today I got my makeup done professionally at Sephora for a wedding. Eyeshadow, eyeliner, foundation, blush, contour... I mean the WORKS. Was skeptical about this actually working on my full face makeup but it did!! And it was only one pump! It’s pricey but it’s worth it and my face feels amazing!! Love this stuff! I originally was using this to double cleanse every night, but I found that that was just way too drying for my skin. Now I only use it to take off my makeup and it does a R E A L L Y good job at that. Makeup just melts right off. My only note - be careful around the eyes, and if you are using it to take off mascara, etc. do it with closed eyes and be sure to wash it off quickly (as with any product getting it in your eyes isn't the end of the world, but it isn't fun).\n",

      "…read more I’ve been using this moisturizer for awhile now and I’ve found it to be perfect in winter or summer. I’m an oily skin type, fair, slight redness, and this does the trick if you like lightweight. There isn’t really a smell either! So I think it’s decent for sensitive types. I absolutely love this gel-cream moisturizer! My dry zones on my face have disappeared, and I love how fast this soaks in. After trying out multiple moisturizers, I stumbled upon this one and have just repurchased my second refill. I highly recommend if you’re looking for something lightweight and effective! Not at all greasy. Dries without leaving my face dry. The best thing is that a little goes a long way. This is my favourite moisturizer. My skin is very oily and I have avoided moisturizing until I found this one! I've been using it for 2 years and tried a few other gel moisturizers but none were as good as this one. love it for combination to oily skin. it absorbs really quickly its similar to the belief aqua bomb By far my favorite Kiehl’s moisturizer! I have oily skin and this formula works perfectly to hydrate my skin at night after applying topically treatments! Easily absorbed and my new favorite nightly moisturizer! So lightweight, this gel-cream feels like a cloud on your face! Non-greasy and absorbs well. I use this as a summer moisturizer as my skin usually gets particularly oily in the summer months. My skin loves this and is so much more matte! Honestly, I bought this product because the ultra facial cream was sold out! I have oily skin, so I figured why not try a gel moisturizer (I'd never heard of it before). I LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER. A little goes a long way, it rubs in so creamy, but then dries completely matte. I use it before bed to give my skin a break from SPF overnight. Definitely worth it! Great moisturizer for all skin types! Been using this for years and I love it. I’ve gone from normal/dry skin to oily/acne-prone skin back to normal skin after accutane and I’ve used this throughout all the types. It’s light but very hydrating, perfect for the summer. It leaves my skin hydrated, plump and soft. Absolutely no greasy residue and works great for the dry patches I get sometimes on my cheeks. If you like water creams but want more moisture/hydration without losing that quick absorption, definitely give this a try. It can be used day or night (especially if you have oily skin) but I’m personally using this in the AM only right now.\n",
      "…read more Repaired my bumpy dry skin within 4 days. This product is amazing, highly recommend. It does exactly what it says hydrates the skin and makes it feel fresh. It absorbs quickly. I use it after I wash my face before bed and after I wake up. Not disappointed. Lightweight and absorbs quickly and doesnt make me more oily I’ve been using this for YEARS. Even though they recommend using before moisturizer, I use after as a last step before SPF. When I use this before, my moisturizer doesn’t soak in as well so this works best for me to lock everything in. I use it in the morning but in the past have used it twice a day. I’m fairly dry and can tell if I don’t use this daily. It helps with texture, sometimes I use it in my hair. Love it under makeup. Can’t go without it. Only downside is they used to sell a small trial type size which is how I got hooked on it. Wish they still did so people could see the benefits plus it was perfect for travel.\n",
      "…read more I wish that I had discovered this sooner as I have very dry sensitive skin! This oil along with the Vitamin Nectar serum are a dynamic duo for my skin. My skin is even toned now, smooth, supple, and radiant! I will definitely repurchase! I have a combination dry and oily skin. My only problem is dry skin around my mouth and between by brows. I found this face oil that works, Finally a product that smells delicious and feels clean. I love this so much. I highly recommend this to everyone. Try it out! Great product, I put it on after my moisturizer at night and I wake up with very soft, hydrated skin. This oil is the best!! One or two drops is all you need. You can either layer it or combine with your moisturizer for a little bit of a boost. When I use this I notice my skin is smooth, and has more elasticity, and feels and looks supple. Hydration at its best for a healthy appearance. I will definitely buy again, and highly recommend to anyone I use this product morning and night! When I get out of the shower or wash my face. This is the next step after toner! It smells divine with a natural fragrance. Whatever I have left from application, I rub down to my chest and tops of my shoulders. My only complaint is its price because I use it so much I have the driest of dry skin. All year long my face basically a desert. This stuff has been SUCH a game changer for me. I have used every oil under the sun and i swear, nothing moisturizes and nourishes my skin as well as this does. Anytime I try out a different oil, i miss this one. I put a thin layer on my at night before moisturizer and wake up with moisturized and plump skin. A lot of reviews mention how horrible the smell is, but I actually really really like it. It smells super relaxing and spa like to me which makes the entire experience of using this oil feel super luxurious. I would suggest smelling it in store or getting a sample before getting a full sized because it seems to be a scent you either love or hate. But scent aside, this oil is amazing and definitely a holy grail for me!\n",

Using this oil my skin is moisturized, bright and luminous . Love! I have had chronic moderate acne for most of my life with sensitive, combo skin to match. I’m also extremely pale so my acne scars become bright red. Almost everything I’ve ever used has broken me out or done nothing; even Cerave gave me an allergic reaction. My skin was cracking a few weeks ago and a Fresh representative working in Sephora recommended this to me since I’m am allergic to many synthetic fragrances and this has 100% natural fragrance. I’ve been patting three drops into my skin morning and night and I swear it has started fading my hyperpigmentation while fighting my breakouts, even when my hormonal acne tried to flare up. My skin still isn’t perfect, but it’s hydrated without being oily, my scars are fading, I’ve had less acne, and I have been comfortable without wearing foundation in public which is huge for me. It is pretty expensive but considering how little you should use a day and the size of the bottle, I would say it’s a good investment.\n",

My skin is extremely dry and sensitive so I have to put this under my other moisturizer in the morning and before my night serums and cremes. This face oil has all the omegas my skin needs without the toxic crap that other products have. Since my skin is so light and sensitive I break out in rashes and sometimes even pimples at my age with certain products. This product is so good for my skin my skin glows after I use it. It makes my other products work better and my face look better when I use it under my moisturizer. My face looks instantly younger because it hydrates and gives it life again like I was younger. I can't live without this product.\n",

I like to pat it on my face instead of rubbing it. I feel like it works best that way.\n",

Soo worth the price and it smells so good. moisturizing enough and is very gentle but still cleans my skin. the 250 mL bottle lasts me around ~6 months with twice daily use. other toners I've used have been very drying but this maintains the moisture balance in my skin alongside the soy face cleanser and the lotus youth preserve moisturizer.

This product plumps up my skin and makes it look much more cared for! I can only speak for those with oily skin, but this product doesn’t cause excess oils! I would recommend a serum with it as this alone isn’t enough, but it’s an amazing product as far as non stripping toners go! This is one of my favorite products. Always keep the travel size in my purse for a quick pick me up. Use throughout the year to keep my skin moisturized in the winter and feeling fresh in the summer. Wonderful product! It's so fresh feeling and the light rose scent is awesome!!! I love this toner I use it everyday and I think it is so cool that it is made with hydrating roses its perfect for my skin.one time I put it on and went to the store and they smelled it and I told them where to get it I think this is the best toner ever.

I didn’t think much of it when I first got it though a subscription but it really does keep the eye are bright and moisturized and de-puffed. My holy grail eye care product for the mornings! Instantly brightens and tightens in an unbelievable way. I prefer the smaller size so I can gently circularly massage out the fluid that gathers under my eyes when I sleep. It is very hydrating and a great primer for under eye makeup. I wear it every single day if I’m wearing makeup or not. It’s even perfect for before a casual workout class. If you put on too much it can definitely be a balm, so if you are wearing makeup make sure to use a small amount which is genuinely all that you need.\n",

Also it does wonders on my skin to wake me up in the morning. Ive loved milk makeup for a while now but this product is AMAZING! It feels great in the morning since its to cool and hydrating, and helps with de-puffing your eyes. I love love love love this product. Learned about Retinol in Dr. Young's youtube channel and decided to give this ingredients a try. Start using this product 7 days after my morpheus 8 treatment for only my evening routine, and my skin was instant healing and smoother. I was told it took up to 3 months to show the result, but the result was noticeable for me. Now I also pair this product with Clarisonic massager which I think it's really helpful for the absorbent. Can't wait to start using Dr. Dennis' vitamin C Collagen for my morning routine. The only downside of this cream is that it may not be hydrated enough where I would use a drop of facial oil before applying this cream! Anyways, I gave it 5 starts and recommend other ladies who has mature skin to try it on!\n",

Feels amazing on the skin, hydraes like no other and doesn't make me break out. My absolute favorite face moisturizer. I am a 70 year-old with fair skin. Lately, my skin grew tired of my regular regimen and, along with some sleepless nights and timezone changes, became sallow and bumpy. This product went right to work! The results were so good that my bold neighbors came over to try it. After scooping out little bits for many people, I now need to reorder. I highly recommend this product! Loved this. Felt very light and moisturizing. Will repurchase. Can’t give enough stars!! LOVE. Won’t be going back to my old skin care line that’s for sure (& trust me it wasn’t a cheap one ! ) by far this moisturizer and Dr Dennis Gross skincare products are exceptionally made to keep skin healthy glowing and young. Your skin will thank you and you won’t be disappointed! I have only had this product for about 2 weeks and I already see a huge difference. I use the brightening serum before I use this and it is crazy how much it works. I am 32 yrs and I noticed there were a few wrinkle lines on my forehead between my eyebrows and where I smile. I wanted to get a head start on my skin care game and make sure my skin is fully hydrated before I begin to age anymore. It has been 2 weeks and the lines have completely disappeared. My skin feels very hydrated and also my pores have gotten smaller. My skin feels great, I barely need makeup but when I do wear make up it goes on so smoothly and looks great. Very happy with this product! FYI my skin is combo\n",

I was a bit skeptical whether this would help reduce the appearance of my fine lines, but after a couple weeks, my skin was noticeable younger looking and oh so soft. I admittedly purchased a different face cream to try after finishing this one, which was a huge mistake. I ended up purchasing this again before I even finished the other. Love love love. Had a sample in a store and have been using for three days. I see some improvements in my skin in the morning. The skin is more glowing and no red color around my nose. But i am using it after applying alfa beta pads. So im not sure what works- cream, pad or combination. Anyways, i love result. I returned to using this moisturizer after trying another one. I didn't like the way my skin felt when I used the other moisturizer so returned to this one. I have problem skin. Meaning I break out, have large pores and get red and irritated really easily. This did not break me out and made my skin feel WONDERFUL. For being just a nightly moisturizer and not an actual peel I feel this deserves the high ratings. I love how this moisturizes and smooths my skin. Smells great, and goes well under makeup. love this product, I have very oily skin but am able to use this as a facial moisturizer without causing breakout and it works great added into a bath for an extra burst of moisture This Coconut Melt Moisturizer leaves my skin feeling quenched and soft. It is the best moisturizer I have ever used. Best coconut oil I’ve ever used. It serves multiple purposes and a little goes a long way so it lasts a decent amount of time considering how often I use it. My 2-year-old son and I both have eczema (dry itchy skin with some scaly patches) and this works wonderfully to soothe itchiness and redness. I slather it on my legs before jumping in the shower so that it had time to warm up while washing my hair, etc, then add shaving cream over it to shave my legs and it has stopped the razor burn & itchy dry feeling I always get after shaving. I add a dollop to a hot bath and use it as a bath oil. I use it after showering for my entire body. Looks beautiful on the skin in the summertime, tames flyaways on my hair and is fast absorbing and non-greasy. And it smells DELICIOUS!!! Husband loves the scent so don’t even need perfume. Love this stuff!\n",

It is the best moisturizer I have ever used. Big fan of this product. Love all Dr Dennis Gross products. This is highly moisturizing but isn't sticky or too thick. Totally recommend! I got a bunch of samples as a present and because of how sensitive my skin is I was very hesitant to try it. Well my most recent break out was on my face pretty bad and I caved and tried it and it felt instantly better and by the next day the nasty rough patches, and alot of the puffy redness went away. I've never seen anything calm it so fast and soften my skin over night it's a life saver for eczema prone skin. Great product. The texture is incredible. Velvety soft with enough weight to penetrate. Feels like a drink of water for your skin. Would classify as a neutrally good moisturizer. I purchased this from the help of a Sephora skincare expert. I was telling her how I am combo and my tzone always looks greasy and I know it’s my oils coming through becauSe I do not drink enough water and my skin is dehydrating. So she shows me this brand and I must say after a few a days of trying this along with using the universal 2 step pads I have seen such a difference. I skin has less texture and boosted my hydration. At first I got worried because a lot of reviews say it broke them out. But I haven’t not broken out or anything after a week. It is pricey but I feel like most of the really good skincare brands are around this price.\n",

I haven't broken out either but rather look like my skin is super healthy. Everyone is different, of course, but don't let the \"all skin types\" marketing deter you from trying this out. Just start off with about half a dime-size and build from there if you have a larger face.\n",

I have been using this as my morning moisturizer every day for the past 2 years, and this is Awesome!! I have moderately dry skin (VERY dry in the winter months) and this moisturizer has been one of my favorite parts of my skincare routine. The gel-like texture glides onto the skin and blends in effortlessly. My dry skin soaks it up immediately and thanks me the rest of the day for it! After 12 hours, my skin is just as soft and hydrated as when I first put it on. The scent is wonderful and barely there at the same time with is awesome. I would describe it as the smell of fresh air if your're standing near the ocean. Very clean and fresh and dissipates in less than 60 seconds.

I was using La Mer for about a year and decided it just wasn’t working for me. So I went into the store and was recommended this product by one of the salespeople. She said that when clients come in looking for something similar to La Mer without such a high price point, she always recommends the AMOREPACIFIC brand. I am so glad I listened to her because she was spot on. This moisturizer is light but hydrating. It smells lovely but it’s not over powering. I have oily skin and I felt like the La Mer sometimes would just sit on my skin. This stuff absorbs so well and once it sets in it doesn’t leave my face feeling greasy.

A little bit goes a long way (as others have mentioned) so much so, that if you use too much product it will not easily absorb into the skin and is why I think a few people had issues with it leaving the skin “tacky”. I’ve never felt that way with this product, however. A pea sized amount (or less) will cover the entire face. Thank goodness, because that really helps it to last longer.

This is by far the best. I hate paying $100 for a moisturizer, but I promise it is worth it! To say that I like this moisturizer would be an understatement. I absolutely adore how fast it absorbs and how it leaves no stickiness behind while heavenly moisturizing. It uses less water than similar products in its composition but a higher bamboo extract concentration. While it may seem pricey it is well worth it. One of my holy grails! I've spent the past 18 months looking for the perfect moisturizer and I FINALLY FOUND IT!! Before I get started, here's what I tried before I found this amazing product: Lush Vanishing Cream, Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer, Kate Somerville ExfoliKate Glow Moisturizer, The Lancer Method Nourish (tried both the original and the blemish control), and Tatcha Water Cream (this was my second-fave). I have sensitive, combination skin that gets oily in my t-zone and dry around the edges of my face. A Sephora employee recommended I try the Amorepacific moisture bound hydra-gel, and it has changed my skin! I no longer get dry anywhere, and it has helped reduce the oil in my t-zone. My skin tone is more even, and my skin looks brighter. I use this moisturizer day and night and it lasts me about two months. I absolutely LOVE this product and am so, so glad I found it!! I also went through cleansers with each of the above brands, and the Amorepacific Treatment Cleansing Foam is a DREAM, and I'll leave a separate review for that.

The fragrance is soft and fresh when you first apply it but it goes away within minutes of application. I wouldn’t recommend a high priced product to other Sephora beauties if I didn’t strongly believe in it but this one is the real deal. It’s a game changer! By the way, I’m buying a new full sized jar today!\n",
      "…read more Best moisturizer I bought Yes, it is on the higher end of things BUT I decided to splurge and give it a try and I'm really glad I did because it has truly transformed my skin. During the summer, my skin went from dry to early and now after using it daily my skin is back to normal and its great! LOVE IT Hydrates your skin really well for makeup application. Makeup lays nicely on top of it and doesn't pill. This is a dry girls must have! Although, if you are looking for pore filling, I would pair this with a primer that is specifically meant for pores as this product doesn't offer much of that This product is a good primer. I have dry aging skin and it really does help moisturize and my skin DOES feel smooth and ready for makeup after applying. I've had this product for a while. But I didn't know how good it is until recently. I've been looking for moisturizer that works with my skin. But I didn't find any. I've only always use this under foundation. However, recently, I started using it as moisturizer when I don't want to wear foundation. It is great! I can tell the difference when I wear this as the moisturizer and when I don't have it on as moisturizer. It makes my skin smoother and softer.\n",

I have dry sensitive aging skin and have a hard time finding Primers that help with age lines. I am so happy with this purchase. It’s light, moisturising, and plumps my laugh lines. I’m extremely impressed with how this primer does so many things. My makeup lasts 12 hours looks beautiful. I have received so many comments on how beautiful my complexion looks. It is very light weight and locks makeup in place. It is worth every penny.\n",
      "…read more Love this even for my really oily skin. It makes my makeup look good and lasts most of the day at work. One of my fav primers. Some primers just feel too matte if that makes sense or that silicone puddy feeling. This makes me feel like I’m actually moisturizing and prepping my skin correctly. Not heavy. Doesn’t break me out. Does the job. One of the best primers out there. I use this under different types of foundations to keep a hydrated healthy skin look. I have extremely dry skin and have searched for a primer that will keep my makeup looking natural all day and this is the only one that works for me! I normally hate smashbox primers, and generally feel like all primers I've tried (drugstore and high end) are kinda useless. My skin is on the dry side, so it's hard to get a nice smooth canvas. I actually felt like this product did the job of a primer though!! It definitely helped for the moisture aspect, and my skin DOES feel smooth and ready for makeup after applying. I'm so dry that i've been refusing to use powder in my makeup routine, but now that I use this primer I find I can use powder to set my makeup and not look crusty. No complaints about this product\n",
      "…read more I have never really been into primer and with dry, acne-prone skin it was something that I often avoided. But, after using a sample size of this primer, I bought the larger size and have not regretted my purchase in the least! It helps a lot with keeping foundation coverage looking even and helps me to use less of my foundation.. Also, it does not make my skin drier and does not break me out. I have sensitive eyes as wells and, while I do not use this primer on the skin below my eyes, it does not seem to irritate the area around my eyes like some other skincare products do.\n",

Thank you smashbox for bringing this into my beauty regiment. My skin and makeup looks fabulous! Please don’t stop making this! I had a Perk service and this was the product used to remove my makeup. This argan cleansing oil easily removed my makeup and also helped hydrate my dry skin. PLUS, this oil smells amazing. I bought a full size following the service. Love this product. The texture is a little strange when you first use it but if you can get used to it you will love it! I have no blackheads after using for just two weeks! Soft but so effective, love it! One bottle lasts me approximately 8 months, it’s unbelievable. I’m on my 4th or 5th or 6th purchase. Can’t live without. Removes makeup well and smells fantastic. Plus it’s clean. My favourite skincare product. Moisturizers the skin during every wash. I have used it for many years and it has never failed me. Fantastic product if you are looking for soft skin. My eyes tend to get really agitated and sting with eye make up remover...and even then it takes forever and I still have residue later. With this stuff, it is fast and effective. Yes, it is pricier, but to me it is worth it. My eyes do not hurt and my skin isn't burning. I love this product. It smells divine. It cleanses well. It leaves my skin moisturized. Can't go wrong! I adore this cleansing oil. It has completely changed my skincare regimen. I used to use a gentle soap cleanser or exfoliating cleanser day and night, and now I use this oil cleanser at night (it removes all makeup too!) and simply splash water on my face in the morning. I pair with the Josie Maran whipped argan face moisturizing cream morning and night. My skin is balanced, and I rarely have to use any concealer, foundation, or tinted product and it looks great.\n",

It smells lovely, though as I remember reading in another review, it tastes awful if you accidentally get it in your mouth. Definitely apply to dry hands and skin.

Think again\" \"you think micellar water isn't going to make it feel like your mom got tear free shampoo in your eyes, haha\" Seriously though, this product is my holy grail, it removes all my make up and cleanses my face.

After using the Argan Cleansing Oil for the first time, I instantly noticed results. My skin was smooth and my laugh lines less we’re less apparent. I LOVE this product! I really, really, really wish I didn’t love this essence. But I knew after using it just a few times, that it would always have a place on my skincare shelf. It’s a very simple formation — only a few clean ingredients — which my hyper-sensitive, acne-prone skin really appreciates. The main star of this product is fermented green tea. It nourishes, hydrates and heals the skin extremely well. If you find yourself in the midst of an over-exfoliation crisis (been there) or a bad breakout (me, every month from being an idiot who tries too many products), you need this! I highly suggest keeping your routine simple and just using a gentle cleanser, this essence and a dab of moisturizer. Then watch your skin thrive!! I also want to add that I have tried basically all of the holy grail essences: SK-II, Tatcha, Missha, Neogen, Primera, etc. Amore Pacific is the all-round winner for me! Just wish it wasn’t so expensive :(\n",
      "…read more I LOVE this stuff! I received a deluxe sample from Amore Pacific and my skin was transformed! I don’t know what it did but when I ran out and stopped using it, my acne returned. It’s expensive but a little goes a long way. I’ve purchased my first full size bottle and it’s worth the splurge. Simple product with great quality. Really enjoy using this essence. First thing I start with after cleansing. Absorbs quickly. I’ve noticed my skins redness has improved using this. Like that it doesn’t have many ingredients and serves its purpose. I tried this and at first I didn't notice anything. I felt like I was just putting water on my face. I gave it 2 wks and wow, you will just start to look better. I don't know how to describe it. When I don't use it my face doesn't look as vibrant and alive. Expensive, but worth it! Love, love! Am a kombucha fan so I was excited to see this product. I am using lots of acids to help with melasma. My skin is very tight and nothing had helped. I tried this after a facial and my skin felt so much better. This am no dryness!! Already my skin feels better. Am a true believer. I initially received this as a sample from an Allure Beauty Box. At the time I wasn’t really taking care of my skin - just using a regular facial cleanser and that’s it. My skin wasn’t in very good shape. With all this, I used the product and saw pretty immediate results the next day and even more results with each day. Think, “Are you wearing makeup?” - someone asking you because your skin looks so good that you must be wearing makeup but one can’t really tell if you are. I splurged and bought the full sized product. A little goes a REALLY LONG WAY so this should last you close to or up to a year or so. I use it morning and night. I would add this at the very minimum to my skincare routine if nothing else. This is the first and one of the only products I have ever used that have wowed me to the point that I very highly recommend it to anyone. I’ve recommended it to family and my hairdresser, colorist, and so forth. I bought the largest size.\n",
      "…read more I have sensitive and dry skin, which breaks me out easily especially when comes to the Winter season (or Season-changed time). I found this product by accident when I was looking for Sulwhasoo ( the other K-beauty brand in Korean), the association recommends it. I strongly recommend u to try, even if it is a little bit expensive, but definitely desire the money! This product is amazing! Totally worth the price - cleared up my skin, and left it looking hydrated and even. I love AmorePacific products, and this essence is no exception. I use 3-4 drops after cleansing, morning and night, and it leaves my skin looking and feeling so smooth - even before moisturizing. It’s expensive, but my first bottle lasted me almost eight months. It’s a wonderful product that will definitely remain a part of my daily regimen. I love love love it!!!! I’ve used many different brands of toners from expensive to inexpensive and this is by far the best one I have used. Within a week my face has shown clarity and it’s only getting better day by day. Saves my skin from drying out and reduces redness. I use it at night before my acne retinol creme. It really helps me from waking up with irritated skin. I noticed a difference when I stopped using it daily when I forgot it on a trip. I don’t use a cotton pad and the bottle has lasted me a very long time. I might buy the smaller size next time. I received this in my boxy charm and absolutely loved it. Bought another in the add-on store. This moisturizer soaks right into my skin and doesn’t leave me feeling sticky or greasy. It has absolutely ZERO scent, too. I’ve tried entirely too many moisturizers and I’ve finally found the perfect one for me. This seems like more of a product for oily skin as it’s water based and very lightweight. I do like how it as a morning moisturizer under my makeup though. Very smoothing and spreads easily on my face. It plumps my skin before my makeup without being too heavy or oily and breaking up my foundation. This is perfect if you have dry skin before makeup and want something lightweight, or want to achieve the trendy dewy look.\n",
      "…read more Absolute. PERFECTION. Combatted the dry Canadian winter that my previous moisturizer was really struggling with. Helps to pat it on like the package says This is my baby. Not a strong scent, good coverage for a small amount, and non greasy. It soaks into my skin and makes it so soft. This goes on so smooth and though it’s thick it doesn’t leave your skin feeling cakey or weighed down. I like to apply this and then use my jade roller at night for a perfect calming effect. I didn’t like this product at first, I felt like it stayed very tacky after I applied it. I started using a bit less, and rubbing it in on circular motions a bit longer. That made a huge difference. It dries down, isn’t tacky, and honestly it’s BEST moisturizer to use under make up! My make up looks flawless now, and honestly I wouldn’t use anything else after getting use to this! I hated it the first few times I used it- it made my skin feel hydrated but was really sticky and heavy. BUT, now, 2ish weeks later, I'm in love with it. My skin has changed completely, it used to be dry and rough and now its sooo smooth and soft, my skin has never done this. Its like glass. Its really hydrating and I feel like my pores have reduced in size too. My makeup has a flawless finish whenever I use this underneath ( primer). Highly recommend\n",

Its very light in consistently and doesn't crease. I wouldn't say this is my favorite product, even though it does it's job. I like the Becca corrector slightly better because of the brightening. If you want a corrector this would be a good first product to try. This is sooooo soooo good. It has completely surpassed and replaced my Becca corrector. Smooth, natural, not too emollient or shiny for my aging undereye area, correcting and brightening, and most importantly, it does not crease if you set it properly. I highly highly recommend this product for anyone who has been struggling with dark circles, puffiness, and/or that “tired eye look” . I love it so much that I want to buy a backup just in case I misplace this one!\n",

It’s crazy the difference it makes. This is a great product! Covers and blends beautifully. Looks natural! No creasing or settling into fine lines. It seems like a very small amount of product, but a little goes a very long way! However, it definitely needs to be set with powder as it can be a little sticky if it’s not. I absolutely love this product. It is tacky and stays in place all day. I have some pretty dark circles that concealer was not enough for this doesn't cake or make fine lines look any more obvious You know when you just know this is the one? I’ve used this once and it brightened everything up without looking like I just covered my under eyes with concealer. I didn’t even need to layer concealer over top! I’m in love. It also doesn’t cling or exacerbate dry spots ..... 5 start product. This will be a staple. Amazing, covers my under eyes like a dream. I got it because of Allana’s video, so happy i did!! Brightens my undereye areas and is a great primer for eyeshadows. Love this corrector! Oftentimes it's the only face makeup product I use. It always looks flawless and makes me look awake. The product doesn't crease or dry out my eye area. A little goes a long way with this product. I apply it with a damp beauty blender and this I find to be the best way to melt the product into the skin (not fingers, surprisingly!). this item is a game changer.. I have mature skin and the less product under the eyes the better.. I use eye cream a bit of concealer and a touch of this and im done with my under eyes.. great product.. Love this—a little goes a long way. Light-weight, great for daily use. Blends as a primer beautifully with my makeup. Does not clog pores like other high SPF products. Will be getting another bottle. I have been using this for the past three years and love it. As anyone with oily skin will tell you, there isn’t much to totally keep the oil away but this absorbs nicely without an overtly white cast and plays well with liquid or powder foundations or even on its own PLEASE NEVER CHANGE THE FORMULA!! This is the only formula that doesn’t break me out or puts white heads in my face. I’m so glad that I found it after so many years trying to find a good spf that benefit my skin. Thank you Algenist!! This is a nice sunscreen. It doesn't sting my eyes nor leave a bad finish. I like the small size because it make it easier to travel with on a day to day basis when I need to reapply. The best face sunscreen I ever had. I’m using for years. It is very light and quick absorbing. This is my favorite Face SPF. This product absorbs and hydrates your skin without feeling oily. It also won’t leave a white cast on your skin....and it’s weightless! This won’t break up your makeup. Blends in smoothly under make up. Prevents oily t zone. No white cast. Obsessed with this product!! This is the second Algenist product that I own and I’m very impressed! This sunscreen is so light & luxurious; it feels like you have nothing on! It also comes with great anti-aging benefits. I put it on right after my moisturizer and my face almost has like a powder-like feel. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I haven’t had any skin reactions which is surprising with my oily skin. Get this! You won’t be disappointed! A little bit goes a long way!\n",

I definitely recommend getting a sample of this product if you're interested in trying it, and then getting the larger size if it works for you! It lasts forever, and I love that the bottle seems very hygienic without me having to put my hands in it. Can't recommend this product enough!\n",

It is light weight and shear and never pills under my foundation or primer. I’ve tried other cheaper spfs but keep coming back to it. It has hardly any fragrance either which I like. Such a great product!! So light and helps leave a very soft, matte/oil controlling finish & the smell is pleasantly mild. My skin is sensitive and breaks out very easily. This sunscreen is lightweight, doesn't leave a white film (I am dark skinned), and keeps me acne-free. Love it! Love it! This does an excellent job of moisturizing my skin without the greasy residue. We need to start applying SPF! Although there are better moisturizers out there, this has to be one of them! I love how it soaks into my skin and a little goes a long way! Especially since it has SPF it is. I have tried the same moisturizer without SPF and this one is a little heavier hence the fact of a the SPF. I just wish it was organic. It’s still one of my favorites! Love this sunscreen! Absolutely amazing I’ve tried different sunscreens and this is a keep! It’s moisturizing and just overall a must have!!!! The best sunscreen ever! Lovely scent, easy to apply and sinks into the skin nicely. No white cast on the skin and no breakouts. I LOVE that it is in a jar and not a pump container. I just got this cream 3 days ago and I have been loving it with my ordinary Rosehip seed oil. I have very dry/eczema skin and I also want to sprite to it skin from the sun so mixing in the spf cream with the oil is the best thing ever! The best thing about this moisturizer spf is that it doesn’t leave your face looking white or anything.

Just make sure to give it an extra minute to absorb before putting on makeup and the sunscreen smell will go away too This is my second jar of this sleep moisturizer! I do love it! Lasts a pretty long time too! Nice cooling sensation once applied to the skin. Faint pleasing odor. Provided nice amount of hydration overnight especially in the drier winter months. I have dry & very sensitive skin and my skin did not break out. I put this night cream over my kheils moisturizer and my skin felt baby smooth and super moisturized. Buy this if you’re on the fence. You’re face will thank you. I’ve been using this product for over a year I believe and have purchased this over 5 times! I love love love it. It’s my holy grail. I have adult acne and sensitive skin. This product has truly changed my life and the way I do skincare. I put in on every other night (sometimes every night) and I wake up to beautiful plump hydrated skin. During the winter I use this as one of my primers to help with the harshness from the cold. I get eczema outbreaks and I once put this on for the extra hydration and it was gone the next morning. I have bought this product for family members and they all repurchase it. My close friends who are skin care addicts like myself, are absolutely obsessed with this item. It’s a must have. A little goes a long way. I suggest also putting it on your neck. This product deserves all the stars!\n",

It’s dry in Alberta so I wear this mask every other night and wake up with such soft skin! It’s my favorite! It takes a few uses to kick in so keep at it! I LOVE IT ! i have very dry skin and it can get red or over sensitive, especially in the winter due to the cold air. but when i wash my face and apply this mask overnight and wash it off in the morning it leaves my face as soft as a baby. i will buy this again!! I absolutely love this. I have oily skin and I know that’s due to dehydration of the skin. Since I started this, I noticed that my skin isn’t as oily as before and that those small dry spots that I’d get outside of my t-zone have subdued as well. I rarely find products I can’t live without... I’m always trying the new, the latest and greatest, but this sleeping mask is one of the best! A little goes a long way, it doesn’t stay tacky or feel thick on my face and my face looks smoother and brighter when I wake up in the morning. Everything I wanted, and then some! The greatest product I have ever bought. Constantly wake up feeling moisturized and dewy. Have convinced 5 other friends to buy it because they loved using it so much Whenever I feel like it's dry outside or if my skin is feeling dry, I use this before bed. I have a pretty complex skincare routine already, so adding this is for those BAD days. But when I do it, I wake up the next morning with quenched skin. I'd say it's important to sit awake with the mask on for at least 15 minutes, as other reviewers have said, to give the mask a chance to soak in. It helps it not be as sticky on your pillow and such. That being said, it is a smidge sticky if you put anything other than a ~thin~ layer on. I wasn't bothered by it though, especially compared to other night masks I've tried.\n",

I found a new staple in my skincare routine ! Very expensive but, this stuff will always be a part of my life!! It has taken me years to find the right skin care line and this Black Tea Age- Delay Cream does wonders to make my skin feel So soft and smooth and full of hydration. You won’t regret it. I like that u can use it 2 x a week. My face felt great I have very dry skin and this is the perfect cream for me Even though expensive but I think it’s worth every penny. Excellent for my normal to dry skin. It leaves my skin very moisturized and soft without greasy look. I use it am and pm and love the mild and fresh cucumber smell. Just ordered my second bottle. Extremely moisturizing. Feels like too much when you put it on but give it time and you will love the way it soaks into your skin! I will be purchasing again! My skin feels hydrated and smooth instantly. Been using it for over 2 weeks and skin feels more firm. Has a nice smell. Absorbs well to skin and no problem applying makeup over it. Will definitely buy this product again! This is by far the best moisturizer I have tried. My skin is sensitive and was getting really irritated by the cold winds of the east coast. I picked it up at Sephora and wow! My skin healed within days. I haven't stopped using it and my skin looks great. I absolutely love this cream. It was hard for me to spend the money and I even tried one of their other creams for about half the price but was not satisfied with the results. I am prone to minor break outs and my forehead is sometimes irritated. But with this product all of that goes away! It really evens out my skin so fabulously that it's worth every cent This oil has been a godsend for my dry winter skin. It’s great for really removing all of your makeup without tugging or stripping away moisture. Good for the sensitive skin. Very nice clean my skin and good for all skin types. No smell. Rinse off easily from the skin. The price and the quality is amazing combination Best makeup remover ever! I’ve had the balm in the past but much prefer the oil. Bought the smaller size and it lasted quite a while but easily worth the money in either size! I love this product, and I feel like it takes all of my makeup off. I use the double cleansing system, so I use this first then use a face wash to take the oil off. The only thing that I don’t like about it is sometimes it’ll fog up my eyes when I’m taking my makeup off. Other than that, love this product, and would strongly recommend. It does the job gently. My go-to for removing makeup especially mascara. Haven’t noticed any harsh fragrances either so five stars! My skin and eyes are a little bit sensitive, so I was afraid of irritation before using it. But it worked so well! It can take off waterproof makeups without irritating my eyes! The best makeup remover I’ve ever used. I tried many cleansing oil including Asian ones. This one never breaks me out. No fragrance, no alcohol. I used to try the balm version but it gave me tiny bumps on my chin. This cleans my makeup verywell with 3 pumps and when I put only sunscreen I use 1 pump and follow with mild jell cleanser. The best make up remover I have ever had. Cleans your skin without irritating it but leaves it feeling clean and hydrated. I have very dry and sensitive skin and it is always hard to find a product that won't be abrasive but still will get the job done I had waterpolo practice everyday and this cleansing oil saved me. With just a little bit of product all my waterproof mascara was gone and I was ready to go into the pool without getting raccoon eyes. THE best, wish it came in a value size / refillable. I use this to take off the most stubborn makeup! It is magic because it takes off everything while leaving my face feeling clean and hydrated. It does not dry out my face at all. This oil has been a godsend for my dry winter skin. It’s great for really removing all of your makeup without tugging or stripping away moisture. Good for the sensitive skin. Very nice clean my skin and good for all skin types. No smell. Rinse off easily from the skin. The price and the quality is amazing combination Best makeup remover ever! I’ve had the balm in the past but much prefer the oil. Bought the smaller size and it lasted quite a while but easily worth the money in either size! I love this product, and I feel like it takes all of my makeup off. I use the double cleansing system, so I use this first then use a face wash to take the oil off. The only thing that I don’t like about it is sometimes it’ll fog up my eyes when I’m taking my makeup off. Other than that, love this product, and would strongly recommend. It does the job gently. My go-to for removing makeup especially mascara. Haven’t noticed any harsh fragrances either so five stars! My skin and eyes are a little bit sensitive, so I was afraid of irritation before using it. But it worked so well! It can take off waterproof makeups without irritating my eyes! The best makeup remover I’ve ever used. I tried many cleansing oil including Asian ones. This one never breaks me out. No fragrance, no alcohol. I used to try the balm version but it gave me tiny bumps on my chin. This cleans my makeup verywell with 3 pumps and when I put only sunscreen I use 1 pump and follow with mild jell cleanser. The best make up remover I have ever had. Cleans your skin without irritating it but leaves it feeling clean and hydrated.

I use this to take off the most stubborn makeup! It is magic because it takes off everything while leaving my face feeling clean and hydrated. It does not dry out my face at all. Absolutely LOVE this moisturizer. Works perfectly for my oily-combination skin and keeps my oil production under control. I’ve also found that it has significantly helped reduce breakouts and whiteheads. It sure is pricey, but definitely worth it!!! I. AM. OBSESSED. WITH. THIS. Super light and absorbs quickly without any oily residue ever. LOVE LOVE LOVE I was expecting to have some bad reactions but this turned out very well. I prefer a heavier moisturizer. Marine and algae extracts usually work out well for me. As someone who hasnt had much success with light layers hydrating enough, and with ceramide products making me greasy, this moisturizer feels like it restores my natural skin barrier. This is my favorite moisturizer! I have very balanced skin when I use this product. I've switched to other brands and noticed how great this particular product is for my skin. It creates a glowing yet matte finish and it keeps my skin feeling normal all day long. Love it! This whole line is amazing for acne prone skin. Have had no issues with makeup applications over this product. I love this product! Paired with the Kate Somerville Clarifying Treatment Toner, my skin is the best it has ever been! I cannot begin to express how much of a god send this product is. I have extreme combination skin. Some spots are extremely oily and others are very dry. After 2 days of using this moisturizer my skin has done a complete 180. My breakouts have gone away, my skin looks dewy rather than oily, and my skin is incredibly soft to the touch but not slick. If there is anybody who deals with adult acne and oily skin YOU NEED THIS PRODUCT!!\n",

I’ve tried tons of moisturizers including shiseido, Chanel, la mer, Lancôme, etc. none of them can compare to this Kate Somerville. This settles in your skin without leaving a trace. After 30s of applying, I touched my face and just felt like never putting anything on it but my skin did get hydrated. Hats off Kate Somerville.\n",

Perfect everyday moisturizer for oily skin. I started using it in the winter and it keeps me hydrated and not oily. And so far I only have one other moisturizer like that from Boscia. Highly recommended for people who have oily skin and struggle with regular breakouts. Absolutely love this mist. I bought the smaller one to try out after seeing someone look so nice and glowy on IG using this. I’ll use it on days I’m lazy to do my full skincare routine at night and I’ll use it before and after makeup application. After my makeup is done and powdered and everything I will like drown my face in this stuff and it just melts everything together so beautifully. My makeup looks flawless. I admit I may use it in excess and keep layering on the mist but I just love it so much.\n",

Perfect \"pick me up\" for flights. I won't fly without it! Love this! I have tried a couple other face mists in the past year and both caused me to break out. The Fresh brand moisturizers have been working well for my skin so I decided to try their Vitamin Nectar face mist- no break-outs with this at all! Smells light, fresh and citrusy, keeps my skin looking even all day and has stopped the dry patches I was getting on my chin. Highly recommend this. Such a fine, moisturizing mist. I wasn’t expecting much because i thought it was a gimmick. But, i live in the desert and this is just what i need to give me a boost. Perfect for bare skin or over makeup. This smells amazing and feels even better! Its pricy but worth every penny This is great. My new office is really dry and so I keep this at my desk to do a little spritz whenever I’m starting to feel a little oily or dry. It helps to make my face feel refreshed and doesn’t mess up my makeup. The scent is nice too So, I bought this product on a whim as a fun addition to my skincare routine. I forgot about it for months, but winter is here and my redness, dryness, and dullness came with the season. I started using this again and WOW what a difference it makes. It is a very fine mist that comes out smoothly, like an aerosol. I really appreciate that, I hate using a facial mist that seems to splatter my face with uneven drops. But, what this stuff really does is fix your face with a beautiful glow. (with or without makeup) I have noticed a decline in my winter redness since reincorporating this into my skincare routine, and I look glowy and fresh throughout the day! Worth the money, I highly recommend. Also has a light fragrance that is non-irritating, and zero alcohol.\n",

The mist is perfect and you don’t get any of those little wet dots on your face after applying. I suffer from dry, combination skin with a little redness in my cheeks and my skin loves this product. I also use it as a makeup refresher mid day and I find my makeup really stays in place. My skin is also extremely sensitive and I’ve had no issues! A little spray goes a long way.\n",

There were some mixed reviews about this product when I can honestly say that it definitely adds value to my daily facial routine and that I find it moisturizing and aids in protecting my skin. I have normal to dry skin and I found that it balances my skin to the point that I use it in the evening before going to bed and most times I don’t need to apply a moisturizer and I find when I wake up in the morning my skin is moisturized and my pH is very balanced.\n",

I have searched and searched for a face mist that does not make my makeup look so dry after a couple of hours. I have used them all! All the other sprays have made my skin look so dry and chalky after a couple of hours and made my wrinkles look worse than what they were. I have been using this for 3 days and I am amazed and in shock with how it performs! The best part is it is good for your skin! I spray this on even when I am not wearing makeup. It sprays such a very fine mist that is amazing. You do not get saturated. You also do not waste the product. Thank you to fresh for producing a product that is so amazing.\n",

It smells amazing!!! Always leave me glowing. And the nozzle is good too. Will probably repurchase. I originally purchased the small one to try it and once I did.. I knew I had to buy the full size (hello Rouge 20% coupon!) I love to spray this after my serum and before my moisturizer. The smell and the fine most are both amazing. This has become a HG for me. So refreshing and leaves my skin feeling extra hydrated where I need it! Love this! I use this every night as a nice refreshing hydrating boost! This has a very nice fine mist. I will definitely repurchase. I’m using this mist in conjunction with Pixi Glow Mist. I use the Vitamin nectar during my skin routine as my essence step. My second step is the Glow Mist. My skin is dewy and hydrated throughout the day. If I just feel like doing my skincare only -then I just use the Fresh vitamin nectar spray. Fantastic results! Started on a prescription retinoid, ultra scary on my already consistently dry skin. This has been the only moisturizer than can keep my skin from turning into a crackly peeling mess! It’s got a good, thick texture - and absorbs well if you give it five to ten minutes. I use it at night with a heavy moisturizing oil on top, and during the day with a lighter oil after applying this. It’s great under makeup, and my boyfriend keeps telling me I have “baby skin,” haha.\n",

I have really dry skin and usually use the drunk elephant facial oil in my skincare routine. However, since using this product I rarely use the oil anymore. Love the feel, super hydrating and makes my skin feel smooth I have had a hard time finding the perfect eye cream. I tried several, and no luck until I found this eye cream. It has worked great for fixing my dark circles and making my skin moisturized. I use concealer every morning and use this eye cream underneath and it is perfect! I would highly recommend! This moisturizer has seriously changed my skin! I have dry, sensitive skin with an oily tzone. I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that won’t irritate my rosacea, or won’t make my skin oily. I can use this day and night; at night I use this as the last step in my skincare routine and I wake up every morning to smooth and soft skin! I have also noticed that it has helped my redness be less noticeable. I can not recommend this enough!\n",

Absorbs nicely and doesn’t feel greasy. Wake up and my face feels amazing. Must have Rich cream with a pleasant, light scent. I needed a new moisturizer and got a sample and remember loving it. I bought the full size and will probably stick with this for a while. It has kept my skin very soft. I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing my skin looked after about two weeks of using this!! I love it! I have combination skin, prone to breakouts but also starting to worry about fine lines and hydration. This cream made the texture of my skin smoother, less red and irritated. Did not break me out. I never write reviews but seriously needed to rave about this product!! Buy! The single best moisturizer I’ve ever used! I have dry skin with patches of eczema. The first night I used this, my texture disappeared, and my facial eczema has been under control ever since. I wish they made a cost effective body version. The smell is very light and dissipates quickly. It’s a very rich cream but easy to spread and you don’t have to use a ton. One jar has lasted me 5 months with 2x daily usage. I’ll never use another moisturizer as long as they keep making this one!\n",
      "…read more I have used two other belif moisturizers with good results, so I ordered this when my skin was in need of something more intensive. I have been so dry recently that halfway through the day it feels tight and uncomfortable with a light moisturizer in the morning. After using it the first night, I woke up with buttery soft skin. A week after using it at night and in the morning my skin is super soft and smooth all day, and I am just disappointed I didn't splurge for it earlier. I have had no new starts of pimples, so I don't think it will make me break out. I know a lot of people are recommending it as a night cream, but it also soaks in pretty quickly, so it layers well under makeup if you want to wear it in the morning.\n",
      "…read more My skin always looks good in the morning! Love it. Makes my skin dewy and smooth. I use this with the Hungarian Water Essence. I usually break out when switching products; had no issues with the transition, must be because this is a clean product. Best moisturizer ever! my skin stays moisturized all day and significant improvement on skin texture I've never written a review for a single product in my life. I decided to write one for this because it's truly been outstanding. I have rosacea and hypothyroidism, which makes my skin highly sensitive and very dry. This cream is soothing and really relieves my dryness. I don't have anymore dry patches. I'm so thankful I took a chance on this cream. This cream has kept my skin calm and plump after a harsh Michigan winter and a battle with hormonal acne. I absolutely love this moisturizer. The smell, the way it goes on, that it has SPF! It hits all of my needs. It's becoming harder to find in Sephora stores and during VIB events so stock up when you can. Very slight gray cast once applied to my yellow-undertone tan skin. But only noticeable in flash photography. I don't wear any foundation/concealer over this. PRO: Keeps my skin moisturized during dry southern california sunny sky winter. No strong scent. CON: In a tub. Need to use spatula/cotton swab to scoop out right amount to apply to face. Face feels sticky. Love the built in sun screen, it's helped me over the past six months even out my skin tone and decrease the appearance of my sun spots. The texture is wonderful and it’s so nice you don’t have to use a primer after. My make up goes on perfectly My favorite moisturizer so far, and I’ve used Clinique, Lancôme, Philosophy, and Peter Thomas Roth. Best spf moisturizer! As a woman of a certain age, trust me, this is the best you can get - and a good price for the results. I use this every morning, for two years. It leaves my skin smooth, smaller pores, dewey but definitely not oily or sticky, and provides a lovely glow. I get compliments on my skin regularly, and I definitely don't look my age. I \"graduated\" to this level of skin care a couple years ago, but I highly recommend this to younger women to keep your skin healthy and to help you age gracefully.\n",

Allergic to titanium I’ve been searching far and wide for a daily sunscreen product that doesn’t make my skin breakout like crazy. This product fits the bill! It’s also lightweight and doesn’t smell like anything which is nice since sunscreen products sometimes stink. Love this! I've had a gap in my SPF-containing moisturizers since Murad reformulated theirs to become acne-central. This is lightweight and brightening, and provides alot of mositure into my face without causing dry spots or breakouts. The SPF agent is pretty mild and doesn't cause irritation like others. I have been using this for two weeks and the change in my skin is so noticeable. I used to look forward to my morning coffee, but now - it’s this. My friends keep telling me I look so healthy, I’m glowing. The lotion leaves my skin looking hydrated all day, evens out texture, and even seems to mask some of the finer wrinkles I have... the best spf moisturizer! it so creamy and light but really hydrated and protects. full physical sunscreen which is crazy because it’s so so light and does not leave a white cast in the slightest. makes my skin so soft and smooth and wears so well under makeup. i will try other things but will always come back to this. absolutely love it and look forward to applying it every morning. Love this product! Your skin feels protected and hydrated. I highly recommend it :) Absolutely love it. Lightweight and helps my skin look flawless without that cakelike feel. Let me start by telling you that I swear by this oil because it not only made my skin super soft and glowy also added some healthy shine and controlled the fRizz especially in summer. Love this product I am on my second bottle already And have tried so many of tatcha products The best! It absorbs quickly and smells amazing! So worth it! I’ve tried several serums and this is definitely the BEST! I have combination skin and I haven’t broke out once while using this. My face is soooo soft. I use it morning and night. Make my face more glower and very smooth. Loveeeeee it !! Seems expensive but Worth every pennies. ❤️❤️ I love this so much! I’ve been using this pretty much every night for 4 months and I’m only about halfway through my jar! It does not clog my pores or bother my acne prone/sensitive skin! Such a great find. Sometimes on my no makeup days I will add some of this to my face for a beautiful, healthy glow. Also, i feel like it helps my eyebrows grow when I rub it around my brows at night. Just an added perk! Absolutely amazing! Very hydrating (I have dry skin) and adds such a glow! I use this morning and evening after the rice polish and before the silk cream. I adore this oil. It’s a MUST in my skincare routine. It has a light pleasant scent and absorbs quickly. I use it after I wash my face in the morning and at night then seal it in with moisturizer. It leaves your skin with a beautiful glow. I love it! Of all the facial oils I have tried, this one is the best. It absorbs completely and does not leave behind an oily film. It smells wonderful!! It does not irritate my sensitive skin. I use this product at night and purchased this bottle Jan 16/19 and nearly 6 months later I still have lots left. I use only 2 drops then rub it between my palms and pat it into my skin. I will repurchase again and again! This oil is amazing! I use it mainly at night for an extra boost of moisture, but it's lightweight enough to wear during the day. Goes on so nicely and absorbs fast. Have noticed a difference in my skins brightness and pores looking smaller too This product is amazing. It’s not greasy, and when I apply a small amount on my face, my skin glows. I have cystic acne prone skin. This has been exactly what my skin has needed all of these years. My most stubborn acne scars are smoothing over. I highly recommend using the entire Tatcha line. It has been a game changer for my skin. It’s worth the investment. Beautiful oil. Gorgeous packaging. My skin is more compatible with this than Marula. I am so glad I got this on sale today as I waited for a long time to get it as it is my favorite when I went in the Sephora store. I like using it as a perfume and on my face as it is so delicate, fresh and light and smells so good. I never thought I would use an oil on my face, but with the winter cold, I really needed something and thought I would try this. A very light oil, sinks into the skin and provides a soften dewy look. I use it every day and have not had a problem. Truly a great oil. Everything from the light but lovely smell to the little bit of shimmer it gives you, it’s defiantly a luxury oil. It does however do it’s job and helps lock in all the moisture from your products used before it, along with adding a last touch of much needed moisture for dry skin or anyone living in a cold climate. And a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time. It’s also the perfect oil to add into foundation without it getting your skin greasy. It has many purposes and I think it’s worth every penny! Love it!\n",

I even use it for my hair at times. So obsessed with this product!!! It has been a literal overnight miracle. When I wake up in the morning, my skin has an even tone and looks plump. I’ve used other facial oils in the past and this is by far the best for overall “problem area” results. Will be repurchasing! Beautiful face oil. Look forward to using it nightly. Skin is soft and smooth next day. I adore this face oil. Me: SUPER oily, scar easily, the second it seems like the existing cystic acne FINALLY starts disappearing, theres another few ready to take their place somewhere else, I wear light makeup because its not for me but im ashamed of my skin. I can't say I remember where I heard of this oil, but I decided to get a sample of it soon after I heard of it. The first two nights I washed my face, used a toner, slathered on a serum, a treatment and finished with this. I woke up both mornings feeling greasy. I decided on the next evening to give this a more honest try. So I washed my face, used a toner and used this oil. The next morning was skin was beautiful. **MY** skin was beautiful. I have struggled with cystic acne and textured skin and scars-- and I woke up with the cystic acne receding (not as large or painful) and despite the scars, my skin was smooth and healthy looking. Ive been using this over the last almost 2 weeks and (I only use at night) my days are super long -- 10-13 hours long depending on the day. Ill come home and remove my makeup and have one or two painful bumps developing beneath my skin. Ill do my aforementioned nightly routine and within a few hours, the painful bump is less painful, less pronounced/inflamed. My scars: I don't think this is an oil dedicated to reducing scar appearance, but over the time Ive been using this product with my simple routine, scars that should have lasted WAY longer and become WAY darker (because I have the awful habit of picking during high anxiety), are fading pretty darn fast in comparison to what Im accustom. I am completely in love with this oil. Im excited to see what else I can use from this line during the day and with makeup!\n",

I love to use this with my High Frequency Facial Machine 4 in 1 R-F Acne Treatment Machine EMS Tightening Massager for Anti-Aging Wrinkle Remove (Size B) from Amazon. I use this to do a cleanse first. I put the serum all over and put my machine on with the blue light, vibration and positive ion settings.

It cleared up my cystic acne over a few weeks. It was gradual but now it’s glowing. Introducing this and increasing how much I’m exfoliating my skin, has made a world of difference. It’s smell earthy but I find it refreshing. I Iove it so much I started using a small amount mixed in with my moisturizer in the morning- I need that extra oil for this winter dryness! The detox oil is an addition to my nighttime routine I never knew I needed. My skin is very dry and this keeps my face hydrated throughout the night. Currently I am following the oil with the Vinosource Sorbet, but I’m planning to try it with the Vinosource SOS moistuizer for the winter. Best antioxidant facial oil for mature sensitive/acne skin.

Caudalie detox oil help fading most of my acne scars and even my skin tone. the most noticeable it help fading the brown mark around my left cheek which cause from my skin got burned facial waxing in the past.

I don’t like the smell per day but the results are lovely and my skin feels glowing and soft! Thank you Caudalie! This oil is amazing! I use it alone at night, with eye cream, after cleansing my skin - my redness is gone my face looks brighter and I believe that even some of the lines around my mouth have faded. I’m just about to purchase my second bottle I cannot recommend a better oil for my sensitive skin. The scent is woodsy but disappears quickly. This product is incredible. In two weeks of use, the fine lines I was getting around my mouth (smile lines, really) have disappeared. I was concerned at first bc my skin looked like it was purging all the living contents out of it the first couple days, but glad I stuck with it. I have clearer, smoother skin and a move even complexion. I use nightly underneath my moisturizer and in the morning my dry skin is still dewy and supple. At 35, this is exactly what the doctor ordered. Very satisfied and love the whole Caudalie line, this product best of all.\n",

They either too thick, clog pore, or doesn't absorb. But with this oil, omg I love it! it helps my skin with acne, dark spots and even with red spots. I'm not sure how other people think about the scent but it's pretty relaxing for me. Use night time only, 6-7 drops to the palm, massage to face.

Throughout the day, I can feel it if I touch my face, but it doesn’t look shiny or oily, and it doesn’t feel heavy.

I have combination skin and before using this I had terrible, uncontrollable cystic acne around my chin. This moisturizer provided enough moisture to keep my skin hydrated during the cold, winter months in Canada but it also absorbs SO quickly and is not oily/greasy. Since using it my acne is almost non-existent (could be the moisturizer or my hormones finally regulating, I'm not sure) but I finally found a cream that has not broken me out or worsened my acne!

I have dry, sensitive skin too and this works perfect for me. So impressed with this moisturizer! Makes skin so soft and non greasy and balances skin so well!!!! This is my new favorite moisturizer. I put it on last night and all day my face has felt so soft and moisturized. My skin is a little sensitive at times and not prone to acne. I have very dry skin in the winter and this moisturizer keeps my skin plump. This stuff is amazing. I keep mine in the fridge and use it after my cleanser. It has actually helped clean my acne! It's like the holy grail of moisturizers! I will die if they ever remove this product. I use it everyday and have been for over 5 years. Hands down if I could take one thing to a deserted island it would be this. I am oil but also had dry skin in the past due to acne medicine and this product has gotten me through everything and is the only moisturizer I will ever use. I would cry if I could have a lifetime supply of this product. It’s amazing ! After using it for a couple weeks my face started to glow and look great! Definitely getting the big size! I love this product. I have combo skin and it’s perfectly absorbs every time without oily residue. In the morning I feel tightened and hydrated. With the price this sleep mask is the best! My holy grail of sleeping masks! Moisturizing with a mild scent that fades. Wake up plump like you slept well for days! This stuff is amazing!! Feels awesome and I wake up looking like I’ve had the best nights sleep ever! OMG - best overnight mask ever! My skin feels and looks amazing Obsessed. I've been a staunch supporter of their blue Sleeping Mask, but as the weather gets a little colder and dear god I'm getting old, my skin needs extra hydration and this delivers BIG TIME. I wear it over The Ordinary's Vitamin C a couple drops of Resveratrol/Ferulic Acid and I wake up so moisturized, so glowy, I actually haven't been wearing makeup for the last couple weeks. My skin is HAPPY. Love this stuff! My almost 40, combo/sensitive/acne prone skin has no issues with this mask. It feels luxuriously rich smoothing onto my skin then absorbs into a moisturizing but non-greasy mask. I use it a couple of times a week and notice a smoothing if my very deep forehead lines. They aren’t gone, but this helps and I think has even calmed my monthly breakouts. Also, a very little goes a long way so the value is phenomenal!\n",
      "…read more Was between this and the water mask but ultimately went with this one. It’s a richer cream compared to the light weight water mask, still light but more hydrating. Definitely recommend. I am 24 and it keeps my skin plump and hydrated. I use it nightly even tho it says to use it 2x a week. Will rebuy when I run out. Is very effective at an amazing price with a lot of product. So soothing to put on, skin wakes up seriously plump and fresh looking. This stuff really works try it!! ❤️❤️ This product feels luxurious without having to high a price tag. You get over 2 ounces of product and a little goes a long way. I use this at night and let it settle into my skin while reading a book before going to bed. It feels lovely on the skin but it does have a fragrance so if you are sensitive to scents this might be a pass. I love the ingredients and my skin seems to react positively to them as well. In the morning my skin is so soft and plump. I have been focusing more on skin care rather than makeup lately and this product is definitely making a difference in my skin. I am 54 so wrinkles and thinning skin are an issue. This product does not take away the wrinkles, nothing will, but it does plump them up and hydrate them so they are less harsh. I highly recommend.\n",
      "…read more I live in Minnesota so was looking for something extra to get me through the harsh winter. I sampled the blue Water Bank sleep mask before deciding to purchase this one after reading reviews. I've been using this one for a few weeks now and the smile lines and forehead wrinkles I've been starting to develop have been softening and aren't as noticeable as they were before I started using this. I actually noticed a difference in them after the first night. The instructions suggest using it twice a week but I use it every night and haven't had any issues. If you're trying to decide between this one and the blue Water Bank sleep mask, keep in mind that the instructions on the blue mask ask you to apply a separate moisturizer before using it and this one doesn't. That kind of makes up for the $14 price difference in my opinion. They are equally as moisturizing but I do feel like this one helps with anti-aging better. I will be repurchase this.\n",

My skin's hydration has improved significantly, and the effect it has on the appearance of wrinkles has been almost magical for me. I switched from a night oil to this, and I absolutely love the texture and scent. I love how my skin feels the next day! This is way better than the water sleeping mask. A little goes a long way. So it will last forever. I was very shocked how good this lotion is. It is very moisturizing and helped with my dry spots. It is a bit of a thicker lotion than I am used to but it is great for the price point. I use it at night and sometimes during the day before I do my makeup. I highly recommend! classic product that is amazing. great for cystic acne. few ingredients. makes skin happy and healthy. This goes on nicely but I think I prefer the Cream version. Nice for the summer hot days. I am allergic to almost everything and most everything makes me breakout...but I started using this moisturizer many years ago and have not strayed from using it. Magically hydrates dry skin and keeps my whole face moist throughout the day. I live in extremely dry climate weather and cannot ever be without this moisturizer. I’ve started my daughter and son on Kiehl’s skin care regiment and they are loving it too!\n",
      "…read more My ride or die everyday moisturizer! Lightweight and looks and feels amazing under makeup At first I didn’t like this moisturizer. I thought it was too heavy and the smell is kind of chemically. Turns out I was using too much. A pea sized amount is the prefect amount for my face size. My makeup goes on smooth over this and doesn’t make my skin over produce oils. With other moisturizers that have dimethcones in them, my skin ends up feeling dry after it “sinks in” and then I get super oily after a few hours and this one doesn’t do that. This is probably going to be my go-to for the rest of my life.\n",

Only moisturizer I will use in the mornings before my makeup routine. Great if you have sensitive skin. I have combination skin and it does a good job. No breakouts for me! It also replaced the use for primer as it grabs on to foundation well. Can’t say it minimizes pores but it does help foundation stay on longer. When you put it on, your skin will definelty feel moisturized! A bit more than the Ultra facial cream in my opinion.\n",
      "…read more I’ve been using this for years and can say this is the only moisturizer that got rid of my dry patches. I tried everything. My skin was so dry to the point where I couldn’t wear make up. This saved my skin. I use it as a primer and my make up always looks flawless. Nothing compares to Kiehls! I haven’t had dry patches since I started using this. Buy it! Works great for dry skin, especially in the winter! My favorite and go-to moisturizer. Does the job well. I LOVE THIS ! I really really do !!! So I have oily skin, well combination oily, acne prone skin and I adore this. I know some people with acne have said they don’t like this but for me this doesn’t cause me any acne issues at all and it also doesn’t make my skin oily so I think even oily girls can use this. Now for why I love this, it is SUPER hydrating ! Which is actually great for oily skin. Oily skin is just a response to skin that’s actually dehydrated so the more hydration you add to your skin the less oil it will produce, I’ve found this to be the case with this lovely moisturizer. Another reason I love it is because it gives your skin a bit of a glow/dew which I kind of have been more into lately. Last thing that’s great about this is that it can actually double as a primer, idk what it is but it’s so hydrating I guess that foundation looks great on top of it. If I do ever put this on and feel like my skin has a little too much dew before my foundation I’ll just blot with a tissue before applying my foundation. I adore this. I’ve been using it for 6 months and have repurchased and will continue too, it’s AMAZING !\n",

I recently purchased the new Clinique moisture surge and it did not leave my skin as moisturized as this product. AND IT HAS SPF!! It is pricy, try to get a sample first. At 46, this is my daily moisturizer and I will not try to switch again. I love this product, goes on beautifully and has a real nice smell. Makes my skin feel great, and I love that it has SPF in it. The smell can be a little off-putting, but it's worth it for a great product. Moisturizing with being sticky or sweaty. It’s great also because it doesn’t give me a gray or white mask that most spf lotions do. I really love this lotion. I'm in my late 40's and have always suffered with acne. Especially when it comes to ANYTHING with SPF. Then, I tried this product. I've been using it for about 3-4 years and never breakout. It also really protects my face from the sun. I LOVE IT!! Love this - the light smell, how silky my face feels. Love origins products!! I’ve tried MANY, MANY day creams from Sephora, but this is my absolute favorite. My skin feels soft, and loves the moisture this provides. I have very dry to oily skin around the t-zone. I can stop looking for the perfect day cream because I found my forever. Trust me, I’ve been through a lot of creams throughout the years. Before using this, my face used to be so dry that it flakes under my makeup. I’ve been using this serum during the AM and PM and my face has increased hydration by so much. Definitely cannot skip using this in my daily routine. I also have sensitive skin, so I haven’t been breaking out from it either. Obsessed. I absolutely LOVE this product. I’m on my 3rd bottle and I rarely repurchase products.

I've read the negative reviews on this face wash and feel some clarification is needed. This face wash is not a one-stop shop for acne and oil control. In my opinion, full control of either of those in a face wash for us combo/oily gals simply isn't possible; diet, additional skincare regimen items (the right toner, serums, chemical exfoliants), and mattifying primer and foundation are truly the only ways to keep a lid on them. What it IS is a cleanser that's balanced and leaves skin clean and moisturized without stripping it (thus leading your sebum glands to overproduce oil to make up for what was taken, aka shine more zits). Everyone's skin is different. For me personally, with regular use this face wash keeps my acne at bay (minus occasional pimples due to my food choices and/or stress levels). I've also run out of moisturizer and had to use this face wash solo (I know, massive no-no), but post-wash my face has never once felt tight or dried out. That, combined with the face that even as a SUPER oily gal I only need a *literal* pea-size amount of it to properly lather and clean my skin makes it 10/10 for me.\n",

Immediately after each use my skin feels smooth and clean! I have noticed less break-outs since integrating this into my skin care routine. Amazing product! Highly recommended. I have very oily skin and this has helped ne out a lot to control it. My skin looks super healthy When my skin was just feeling and looking crappy, this came in the mail and changed my face for the better. After just 2 days, my skin was actually less oily but more brighter. I may have found my next favorite cleanser! Very good product for the price and amount of product you get. I have combinations of oily and dry skin depending on the weather and I wise this daily. It doesn’t leave me dried out. Do not get this in your eyes because the product does give a tingling sensation. I was breaking out in a few spots on my face (which is rare for me). My sister had bought this and I thought, why not try it? It looked a little better right after I did a spot treatment with this. I only used it in the areas that I was breaking out and it seemed to dry them out. The next day I saw a significant difference. My skin is much clearer now and most of the redness from the break out spots is gone! Definitely recommend!\n",
      "…read more I love this soap so much, ive been using it for years now, right now im trying out different kinds of cleanser and so far this is still my #1 its light in the skin but does its job of cleaning your face and this is the only product that didnt made me broke out. Also, i have a combination skin of normal and oily tzone and this mild one works really well for me. This is my second bottle, I just love to wash my face every night with this soap for my oily skin. This is an awesome face wash! Make sure to also get the toner and lotion! The system keeps my face clear of blemishes! I’ve been using this soap since 2004, it’s a tried and true soap. :) Holy grail cleanser for my sensitive acne prone combo skin. I've been using it nearly every night for at least two years now and the only trouble it gives me is that it CAN be drying if I use too much product, but that's on me. Takes makeup off like a dream. My ride or die. My absolute favorite! I use it (almost) everyday! Keeps my skin fresh feeling and looking. Never makes my skin feel dried out and paired with the Clinique lotion, y face is always super soft! I love this, it made my skin clear up so much. My all time favorite face wash ❤️ One of my favorite cleansers ever. Super simple formula, fragrance-free and rinses perfectly - leaves my skin feeling very fresh and clean. Zero residue or dryness. It’s such an excellent cleanser.. I have backup bottles. Highly recommend! great recommendation from S Coast Plaza staff. use it with my Clarisonic, good combo not too foamy, rinses off clean, leaves skin feeling clean but not dry Love ya his product! Non drying and gentle to skin! We have used Clinique for decades! I love this cleanser! I have combination skin and have been very skeptical of using oil face products because my t-zone gets very oily. This changed my mind completely. It takes off my makeup and leaves my skin feeling very clean and fresh, yet moisturized. Definitely a game changer for me. Easy make up remover. Great to have in the shower. Works well I love trying new skincare and makeup products so I buy something different every time I run out of something in my collection, but for a makeup remover I keep coming back to this one it’s just so good! This product smells good to me and truly melts away the makeup, dirt, all the bad things from your skin. It’s a perfect product if you are into double cleansing! I have oily/combo acne prone skin and I can’t get enough of this! I think it’s safe to say I think I have found the perfect makeup remover and trust me I have tried them all!\n",
      "…read more Doesn’t burn my eyes. Gets all my makeup off and doesn’t hurt my skin. I have sensitive skin and this is my F A V O R I T E makeup remover. I use this nightly and completely love it! I use it with a Makeup Eraser cloth and and my makeup comes right off and my skin isn’t dry or irritated, even in the winter. Before, I always have trace makeup left with other cleansers but not with the Boscia cleansing oil. It’s my go-to nightly cleanser. Love it so much, I’ve stocked up and have 4 bottlesI’m so I won’t run out! Best makeup remover! This don’t just break my makeup down. It also refined my pores. I’ve been using for almost two months. My skin looks amazing! I absolutely ❤️ this and highly recommend. Wow. Oil for oily skin was never on my list of possible items to put on my skin. And my mind has been blown. Takes every single drop of makeup off my face without the slightest tugging or rubbing or irritation. This product does not add any oiliness to my skin but actually makes it feel healthier and softer. I will never use another makeup removing product. One pump when I’m just wearing mascara (the ultra waterproof, won’t come off in nuclear war type) and two pumps when I have a full face done. Love love love this stuff.\n",
      "…read more Takes off makeup/sunscreen like a dream and doesn’t dry out or irritate my skin. I never knew what i was missing out on until now. My holy grail make up remover was the Clinique balm and it always seemed to do the trick....until I combined it with this. Let me just tell you, it felt NEXT LEVEL CLEAN. It took absolutely no effort to get the remaining makeup off and was super gentle around my eyes. After i rinsed it off, my face had this sort of cooling, refreshed sensation. I will 1000000% be implementing this into my night time regime from her on out\n",
      "…read more I really am enjoying this product! I was so impressed with how easily it rinsed off without leaving residue. I was scared it would leave my face still oily before cleansing and that I would be rubbing the oil back into my skin, but it rinses off nicely so that I can cleanse my skin after. New holy grail, 100% will repurchase Already on my second bottle of this! It’s my favourite cleansing oil for double cleansing! Removes all my makeup, sunscreen and other dirt from the day. I use it every night, and honestly I feel like it’s helped my skin a lot - I have combination skin that is blemish prone. Smell is also very pleasant in my opinion and it emulsifies nicely once you had water to the product already on your face! Will keep repurchasing. I struggle with stress related acne and needed a lightweight oil cleanser. This is EVERYTHING I hoped it would be! So gentle, perfect, gets the job done. On my fifth bottle and counting! So gentle but still takes off my makeup. Great for my extremely, extremely sensitive skin. I like to use it after I remove my heavy make up. I use it once a day or less because it is a bit drying, but I do like it since it does good job at removing all the dirt from face. Also, I tried it on make up brushes and it did wonders. Old concealer brushes look like new. So if it doesn’t work for your face it will work for your brushes lol Skin is like velvet! I have been blessed with good skin my whole life until recently when I started getting severe dry patches and uneven tone. I used my Boscia oil cleansing step first then followed with the Calendula and WOW!! I’m not sure my skin has ever felt so velvety smooth. I couldn’t stop touching my face for hours after cleansing! It also made my moisturizer- La Mer - go on even deeper. Please Kiehl’s don’t ever change or discontinue this formula. It is my new holy grail cleanser! If you are thinking of giving it a try - do it!!! You won’t be sorry!!!\n",
      "…read more I’ve been using this product for a while and am super happy with it. The consistency is just right for me. I had concerns that it would be stripping, but I didn’t find that. As my second part of the double cleanse, this is a gentle but effective part of my skincare routine. This is the only cleanser I’ve rebought because it’s made such a difference with my skin. I always feel like cleaners that are more gentle never leave me feeling clean while most deep clean washes dry me out too much. This is the only cleanser I’ve used that feels clean while not drying me out. My pores have also looked better since using it. For years I have been trying to find a holy grail face wash and I have finally found it. This stuff is amazing. It cleanses your face so well without striping the skin. It also has a very light lemon scent to it. Overall it’s an amazing face wash and I would recommend it to anyone. I’m almost out of the smaller bottle and will be purchasing the 16oz one. It took me over two decades and probably hundreds of facewashs to find the perfect one, and this is it. I’ve been using it for almost two weeks, and I feel pretty confident that no other soap will ever touch my face again. It makes me disappointed to only have two face washing times per day, but I look forward to each time. This stuff is magical. Gentle, yet effective in removing make up, and does dry out my skin, and has made a visible difference in my complexion. Do your face a face a favor and put this in your cart.\n",
      "…read more Both my hubby and I really like this cleanser. Feels nice. Gets off make up without drying out my skin. Love the smell. Also love the pump in the bigger size bottle. I was worried it might smell like flowers because of the calendula but it has a light lemony scent. Makes you skin feel clean but not tight and hasn't caused any irritation! Bought this in a whim when I ran out of my cleanser. I was looking for a cleanser without beads so it didn’t wear down my Foreo, and I already use Kiehl’s for my AM moisturizer so I trusted the brand. This is AMAZING! I use as my 2nd cleanser after the Farmacy balm, and my face is so clean but not dry at all. And even a half pump is enough to clean your face and neck, so very worth it for the money; I’m only halfway through the smaller bottle and it’s been at least 6 months. The scent was something I’ve never smelled before my I’ve gotten used to it and I enjoy it now. Highly recommend!!!\n",
      "…read more Awesome cleanser. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin/Rosacea. I was able to take advantage of receiving a facial at Sephora for sending a certain amount. This was one of the products that she used on me. I purchased 3 of the items because I saw such a difference in texture. I would of never gave this a try if I wasnt offered that service. I love the light foam and scent and I can really feel and see a difference. I bought the big bottle and will definitely be repurchasing. Thank you Sephora for leading me to this beauty.\n",

It makes my skin feel very clean but not dried out!! Also, it smells AMAZING!! Really nice foam, makes your skin feel very clean without it feeling tight. Smells gorgeous Holy Grail! Gently cleans my oily sensitive skin. Face feels so fresh after using. I absolutely love this. I love the almost heat and then cooling effect of it. It’s not rough on my sensitive skin, it has the right amount of scrub to exfoliate without causing micro-tears First time I've said, \"oooOOOH!!\" when using a beauty product. The heat on impact was surprising and unexpected. I thought the sauna part would be volcanic rock or something. Nope. I bought the beauty babies kit that had a travel size of this included. I wanted to buy the full size one immediately but I'll wait and see how this plays out. But I'm optimistic this will be my new favorite beauty product and I'll actually find washing my face to be less of a chore.\n",

I like the way my skin feel like I Removed all the impurities, and the warming sensation is so satisfying. Completely love it would definitely recommend This. Is. Everything. I am hard pressed to put any other brand of skincare on my face anymore!! This is exfoliating without feeling stripping and it gets SO WARM when it is first activated with water. It feels so great and relaxing when it happens, I just wish the feeling lasted longer. Seriously does an amazing job of diminishing my pores and keeping my skin clear. I wish the bottle was bigger, it’s a little skinny for the price but Im definitely going to keep using this forever.\n",
      "…read more Omg! I’m a fan. I love the warm feeling when I first apply. This product does a great job keeping my oily skin in check. Love! This is a great gentle exfoliater! It does the job well, but is gentle enough to use 2-3x a week. Smells great too! Ok, so this scrub is unlike any other scrub. It requires a bit of a learning curve but bare with me. At first, when I started using this mask I didn't really like it, it was really harsh and I felt that my face with burning up. However, when I started doing a technique of rubbing it in my hands first and THEN applying it to my face it was a GAME CHANGER! It didn't feel as harsh, and it actually really satisfying! I bought the whole kit (Cleanser, Exfoliator, Mask, and Toner) and out of all four this was the must-have product!\n",
      "…read more Love this. Really gets face feeling clean and fresh. If you have sensitive skin maybe too harsh. I LOVE this facial scrub! My skin feels so smooth after I use it. The warmth that you get from it is an added bonus too! I really love this scrub so far. Only have used a few times, but I’ve noticed my skin is incredibly smooth and fresh after use. The warming sensation is reallly nice. Definitely worth the price. :) I love this product so much!!! The warming and cooling is amazing and makes your face feel so refreshed and clean. I love the gentle exfoliation. The smell is incredible and really reminds me of going to the spa. Once I wash it off and dry my face, it feels perfect. Not too much moisture or oil, not too dry... just perfect! I get legitimately very excited every time I get to use this. A must have! I really like this product. I’ve been using it for a week now and can see a difference in my pores. Make my skin so soft I love this scrub!. It leaves my skin so soft! And I love the hot vs cooling effect it gave my skin when I gently rub it onto my face. I have been using this product for about a month now. My pores are smaller, less breakouts, smoother skin I’ve tried so many toner type products from ole henriksen to Mario badescu. This is the only one I bought more than once and actually noticed results. I’ve been using it with mostly tatcha products as well. It keeps my skin from going out of wack and helps keep my skin look glowing. So I’ve never gotten so many compliments on my skin or have had such a consistent skin tone in all my acne prone life. I swear by this product for all skin issues and types. This Toner is magic when you first try it! It's like putting silk on your face, it's smooth and quite hydrating! If you already use the Facial Treatmente Essence and willing to put some extra money, I recommend getting this toner along with it! I used many other famous Japanese toners and there is nothing quite like this. It does take like a month or more to really see results though but my skin always felt more smooth after using it!\n",
      "…read more What was I waiting for! I finally broke down and bought a SK II package that included this toner. After a few days my skin started to glow, I cannot remember the last time that happened. The more you use it, the better the results. I know it is pricey, but if you are committed to good skincare this is worth it. This stuff is expensive but worth every penny. I started using it at a time when my skin was irritated and breaking out. I tried so many other products to calm my skin down but nothing was working until I tried this. After 1-2 weeks my skin was no longer breaking out and all the inflammatory hyperpigmentation was fading. I have dry sensitive skin and sometimes struggle with acne breakouts. This keeps the acne in check without drying or irritating my skin.\n",

I started with the trial size, used it all, and then after 2 weeks without it, realized I had to have it. I caved in and splurged with this, the moisturizer and the pitera essence. And honestly I think this is the best out of the 3, at least when it comes to immediate results. This toner immediately makes my skin look young, healthy and happy. It evens my complexion and makes my skin look amazing. I will definitely be buying more of this. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "…read more amazing changed my skin on my second bottle worth the cost Evened out my skin. Purchased a kit from SKII and finished the regular sized essence bottle but wished it was this product the whole time. My skin loves this it's the only AHA that I've found that is effective for me. leaves my face feeling baby smooth This is my favorite toner…ever! It’s so gentle that I think it’s not doing anything, but when I look at my cotton ball, it’s removed a ton of dead skin cells! Even after I wash my face well, there’s always something more if lifts off. There’s no stinging or irritation. It’s a perfect product, worth the price! It is surely pricey but for a good reason. It is refreshing and does not irritate my skin unlike many other toners out there. It cleans without drying out your skin and is best used before applying facial treatment essence. Definitely recommended if you can afford the price. I’d give 10 stars if I could! Wish I’d found it years ago. I’ve bought the biggest bottle available and have 2 already in reserve. You have to have this in your life seriously! Love everything about this toner. It’s refreshing and makes my face soft to the touch. Serums and moisturizer absorbs quickly after using this toner. I also love that it doesn’t have strong parfumes. Definitely recommends and will bug again Feels much more luxurious than other toners, almost as if it has some kind of softening effect on skin. I'm still not completely sold on toner actually being a critical skincare step, but this is definitely the nicest toner I've ever used. A Sephora make-up artist used it on me first and I liked it so much I actually bought the bottle. Love this toner. Very gentle; makes your skin feel great. My skin used to be acne prone, but after trying the AmorePacific line, I can say that I have found the perfect products for my skin. This toner, the enzyme peel, and the vintage extract from this brand have all transformed my skin. I love that this toner does not have alcohol. Back then, I thought that toners with alcohol were the most effective in getting rid of acne. I was wrong. This toner balances the pH level of the skin and I think that helps in improving skin clarity. It’s a little expensive for a toner, but it does last for a long time.\n",

I went to Sephora to browse and the skin care employee gave me a full demo of the AmorePacific products, a brand I had never even heard of until then. I bought this toner because I could immediately see the brightening on my face. I have been using this for about a month now, and I still have loads of product left.

It doesn’t dry out my skin and I’ve really been enjoying using it. Definitely going to continue purchasing this! Top notch product. Repurchased during this VIB sale. Removes any feeling of dryness and tightness after facial wash. Highly recommended. leave the skin soft and moist. The smell is pleasant. I can’t use any other cleanser! I have slightly oily skin that tends to break out easily. Im 33, but still struggle with blemishes & breakouts - particularly around the time of a period. with this cleanser, I have significantly fewer breakouts- most months I prevent them all together!

I have sensitive dry skin after going on accutane years ago and have always had trouble finding a cleanser that made my face feel clean but also didn't leave it feeling stripped and tight. This does it for me - after a lot of time back and forth between Fresh cleanser, drugstore ones, and many others, this does the trick. I tried the Charcoal version and it was drying for me.

It leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean without drying or over moisturizing. Will definitely become my new favorite face cleaner. I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT! MY SKIN IS PERFECT ! I USE EVERYDAY! This is a wonderful gentle cleanser that is effective and also has clean ingredients. A small amount goes a long way and the bottle lasts me about 4 months. Love it and worth the money. Does not sting my eyes or dry out my skin yet cleans and has nice foaming action. Highly recommend. The scent is also light and not even noticeable. I got a travel size of this with points and started using it when I ran out of the Fresh Soy Cleanser, and I'm buying a full-size now. I never thought I'd say this, but I like it better than the Fresh Soy Cleanser (blasphemy!). It does a better job taking off my makeup and I like the way my skin is looking. Great face wash. Works well and I enjoy using clean beauty skin product. I have sensitive combination skin and this is perfect for washing daily. It doesn't dry my skin out at all, and after only a few weeks my skin looks great and no new breakouts. It's not strong enough to remove heavy makeup, but I don't really wear any. Those occasions I will use a makeup remover first. One of the best cleansers I’ve used. Makes my skin feel so clean and soft. I love this. It’s clean and smells amazing. It’s super gentle for my sensitive skin and works fantastic with my Clarisonic this is my hail grail cleanser. This is one of my absolute favorite cleansers, smells great and leaves my skin feeling so clean. I really like this cleanser! I double cleanse with a balm before using this. I like that it removes the residual makeup without over drying. I got a trial size from IPSY and will be buying the full size soon. I got this in my Ipsy bag and I’m in love! I used it because it was there but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it removed my makeup. It also left my skin feeling so clean and smooth compared to my usual cleanser. I’m here to buy a full sized bottle before my mini runs out. Really love this face wash! Very gentle on the skin and leaves your face feeling soft and clean. I was worried about the scent because I have very sensitive skin, but I’ve been using it for probably 6 months now and no issues! If you have sensitive skin, get the small version first to try it and see how your skin likes it. 10/10 would recommend! I really love this cleanser. I love the smell, I love the consistency, and I love how my face feels after using it. The only thing I don't love is that one full pump is too much product. I usually try to use a quarter or half a pump. This is an absolute staple in my routine. The smell is incredible and this product leaves my face feeling and looking so clean and smooth. I’ve tried many cleansers and this one is the only one that has been a repurchase for me. I WILL DEFINITELY continue to buy this product. Obsessed of this product!! Cleaned all my pores and help them to shrink. I had a very acne skin type but now my face is super healed and clean BEST CLEANSER IVE EVER USED!!! I started using this back in February 2019 and it changed my life’s. I have very acne prone skin and after using this my skin has been clear. I’ve Also gotten my friends to try it out and it has also changed their lives. Absolutely would recommend. Love this cleanser! Takes off a full face of makeup with only a pump or two. Smells great, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. It also doesn't have any exfoliating beads in it which makes for a nice, smooth texture. The box also says it can be used as a wash off face mask if you spread a layer of it over the face and leave on for 5 minutes. I use this twice a day, morning and evening, and it has definitely been great for my skin. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n",

I tried it and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't drying at all. Actually it's very hydrating and gentle. Plus, I love the added natural AHA to help with dullness.

It not only cleans extremely well (and foams easily) but it smells clean - like a typical La Mer product. I finally decided to write a review as I sit here with my face burning after trying the SK-II cleaning line. I’m not a hype person, I never buy into hype and I always do hours and hours of research and testing before buying something especially when it’s expensive. I used this La Mer Cleaning Foam for one year and absolutely love it. It’s the best cleanser I ever used, period. I have dry skin and this always made my skin feel cleansed without tightening/drying it up and is super gentle for my really sensitive skin that has a mind of its own. I was trying to find a cheaper alternative after I am almost out of this one so I tested a few cleaners. I immediately went back online and bought this again after some disaster situations with other cleaners where I face felt like it was on fire and all red and I realized this is still THE BEST! Sticking to this and I’ve been using one bottle for close to a year now, nuts! So in actuality, it’s not that expensive, also, because it’s priced higher than most others you will be more conscious of not wasting or overusing it which means less plastic waste buying more.\n",

I always use the La Mer Tonic after using this to bring back hydration on skin. This is a great product. I like using it in the winter months when the air is dry. Most cleansers seem to strip my skin of all moisture; however, this one has the opposite effect. After using this, my face feels amazingly clean with leaving a dry and tight feeling. Love it! You wont regret if you give it a try. Left my skin really dry... And it smells like cheap soaps. A waste of money. Love it! One of the best cleansers and THE BEST foaming cleanser I have tried. In the last few weeks I tried few different brands including La Prairie, Lancer, Kiehls, Origins and few more. Some of them were too drying, didn’t remove the makeup or left my skin too dry/tight. La Mer cleanser gel made my skin very dry and irritated, so I tried the foaming cleanser. It foams perfectly, cleans skin well (I also use it with Clarasonic Mia). It is expensive but worth it. Keeps my skin clear, as well.\n",

And used in combination with the Creme de la Mer, the results are truly magical. Only exfoliant I've found that helps milia! An all around wonderful product. I have a pretty good complexion and started to break out after trying a new foundation, a Sephora employee recommended this and it is a huge game changer. The ingredients are very powerful and for the first month or so you use it you WILL break out because it’s pulling out all the funk in your face, after that it’s smooth sailing!

It’s an exfoliating cleanser, it has AHA/BHA To chemically exfoliate your skin but also tiny little micro beads that physically exfoliate as well. But super tiny and in no way abrasive. It makes my skin beautiful for makeup. I was using it everyday but recently cut down to 4 days a week when I am using a chemical exfoliate in a serum or toner.

I use a tiny pea sized amount and am able to clean my face, neck, and chest so while expensive it will last a long time. Love this product so much! It has become a staple in my routine and I’ve purchased it multiple times. Definitely brings my skin back when it has been through it. On my second bottle! I hate the pump as it does squirt out beyond your cotton pad. However, the juicy goodness inside is so magical that I can overlook the packaging flaws. This is a staple in my skincare routine because it is a ph-balanced formula and gives my thirsty winter combination skin a quenching kick-start to my skincare regime. My favorite toner now ! No heavy scent and no alcohol! The only thing that doesn’t irritate my skin during pregnancy This is my go-to morning toner. It’s really moisturizing and I feel so fresh after I put it on. I love this. It does what it says. Will repurchase! I bought these product on after doing some research on the ingredients. I'm familiar with the brand and I enjoy their products. With that being said, I absolutely love this toner!!! It's my new favorite. I'm on the my 3rd bottle already. It's super hydrating. To me, the consistency is like a super watery serum. I use both cotton rounds and my hands to apply the product. It works wonders and the price is great. I can tell the difference when I use a different toner. I think this would work for you if you have sensitive skin.\n",
      "…read more This is one of the very few skincare products that I've actually repurchased. This is the ONLY skincare product that I've repurchased twice. I love how effective yet gentle this toner is. Perfect for literally all skin types. Has been use for years, really good toner for sensitive skins. I love the feel of this toner. It leaves my face hydrating and it was recommended to me by a skin specialist at Sephora based on my skin’s needs. My favourite toner! Super moisturising and lightweight. This toner has done wonders to help me stabilize my sensitive, breakout-prone skin. The moisturizing toner leaves your skin feeling clean, but not too dried out. It wasn't something I was originally looking for when I bought this product, but it has also really helped even out my complexion. I also use this once or twice a week as opposed to every day. I love this. It’s not drying and leaves my skin balanced and clean without feeling stripped. The very light fragrance is a delightful bonus. I've been using this product for years and it is a great exfoliate. After I take my makeup off and wash my face, I use this and it really does take off the rest of everything you thought you cleaned. It makes my face feel extremely fresh and is great to apply before hydrating your body with toner, essence, serum, moisturizer etc. However, this isn't for all skin types. My skin type is normal. I have a friend who can't use this because it's too harsh on her skin, so it isn't for everyone.\n",
      "…read more LOVE this product. It's not that expensive and actually helps remove what you didn't get off after makeup remover AND cleansing! I bought this 3 times, the third time I bought the large bottle because it was only $10 more. But using this every other day (even thought it says everyday, which you can totally do), or just on days you feel extra grimy or was exposed to more gunk, is a SKIN-saver! I've been using this for a little over a week now and it's pretty amazing. I saw results from the first application. It instantly made my skin smoother, softer, and it pretty much eliminated all the dry patches and texture!! Also it helped a lot with acne! Thank God I listened to these reviews. Tried the mini size of this toner from a different set and loved it so I got the big size. I had a few tiny pimples/bumps on my face which cleared out after a few uses of this toner and my skin has been clear so far. However, it does have a fairly strong alcohol scent so you have to be careful not to apply it too close to your eye area. A Sephora employee recommended this product to me and I’ve been so happy with it it! I have used this product for years and am always happy with the results. I stopped using it a few years ago and then started again and I fell back in love with the product. I recommend this to anyone with combination skin like myself. My husband and I both use this, and love it!! It takes off left over make up that I didn’t even know was still there. I absolutely LOVE this stuff!! I have combination skin (mostly oily, though) and occasionally suffer from acne. I’ve been using this for a little over two years now and man, one bottle lasts forever! Granted, I don’t typically use it everyday; usually just when I wear a full face of makeup and want to make sure I get it all off. And let me just say, it does just that and leaves my face feeling fresh afterwards. 1000/10 would recommend!\n",
      "…read more I bought this on the recommendation of the sales clerk because I have very dry skin and it has honestly been the BEST skincare item I have invested in. I have bought much more high end products and drug store but. One of them have given me results as noticeable as this. My skin no longer has dry flaky patches. Will definitely repurchase! I have been using this for about a year now and I absolutely love it. It makes my skin so soft and smooth! This tingles and can sometimes sting my sensitive eczema skin. However, I find it works wonderfully on my t-zone area keeping oil and pimples away. I use #1 toner on the rest of my face. It may seem like too many steps but for my fussy skin, the combo works beautifully! Removes my waterproof eyeliner very quickly and easily (other makeup removers don’t work as well on my MAC liquid last eyeliner) and is not harsh on the eyes. Definitely recommend. Very gentle, quick, and easy to use without making a mess. I use this to remove my makeup every night. Highly recommend it for sensitive eyes. I’m in live with this stuff! I don’t use a cotton sheet to apply the remover. For me it works best with just fingers. To wipe off ; I then use the cotton sheets. I love this eye makeup remover. It’s very gentle and leaves my eye area feeling moisturized. You don’t need much either. It’s also the best I’ve used to completely remove makeup (with other brands I’ve used I have to scrub hard to get makeup off). LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff. I found this holy grail of a makeup remover. It takes waterproof mascara right off without leaving a greasy residue. Yes, this will burn your eyes. So keep your eyes closed when applying. Next, you don't need a cotton pad to use this. All you need is 1 pump onto your palm or fingers. Apply on lids full of makeup, with eyes closed, and rub gently. You may use a cotton pad to wipe away the removed makeup, or wash your face thoroughly. So easy!! I hope they don't change the formula or discontinue this. I use an incredibly waterproof japanese brand mascara that needs its own remover, but this is a wonderful alternative!\n",
      "…read more I've tried every eye makeup remover that claims to be for sensitive eyes. This is the only one that actually removes my mascara AND doesn't irritate the delicate skin around my eyes. A Sephora employee used this on me to remove a bunch of liquid lipstick swatches from my hand and I was shocked at how quickly and easily it took it all off, no scrubbing whatsoever. I bought it during the next sale and have been using it ever since. If you think it's not working then I'd suggest using a little more and letting is soak on a cotton pad first and holding in on your eyes for a few seconds so that the cleanser can penetrate through all the layers of makeup and do not rub or tug at the eye area! We don't want wrinkles so be gentle and just let it sit and do the work for you so that you don't have to go over the same area a bunch of times. Would not suggest going straight in on your eyes without a cotton pad (also works really, really well on a makeup eraser). Would suggest shaking it before each use as I've found it does settle a little bit if it hasn't been used in a while. Would definitely recommend if you wear a lot of heavy and/or waterproof eye makeup. I wouldn't call it a sensitive eye cleanser, I have sensitive eyes and sometimes it does sting but it works so I'll deal with it as it's nothing unbearable and the sting goes away quickly.\n",
      "…read more I was sceptical of this cleanser because I tried other KS products in the past and I didn’t like them. However, now I regret I didn’t try this cleanser earlier! Yes, it can be drying and it does smell pretty strong (sulphur) even after rinsing my face.. but it works. I do not remove make up with it, but I use it in the mornings with my Foreo brush. Love it! This product single-handedly got my acne under control. I tried everything from prescriptions to facials to using the most dull products (Cerave, Cetaphil). Nothing helped me like EradiKate did. A little goes a long way, I love how clean it smells, and I can’t imagine my life without it. If you have cystic acne this product will definitely help you. I love this cleanser. I use it twice a day and it keeps annoying blemishes at bay and fights hormonal acne!! I have clear skin with the exception of random zits here and there but have always struggled with break outs when monther nature comes to town. This cleanser has completely changed the game. If you’re thinking of buying this cleanser DO IT!! I first tried this product back in July when I found out I was pregnant with my first child! I have always liked using an acne/ oil control face wash in the AM but my current one contained salicylic acid which is not safe to use during pregnancy. I talked to my doctor about pregnancy safe alternatives and did lots of online research which led me to this product. Not only is it pregnancy safe but it is probably the most effective acne cleanser I have ever used! I have far fewer breakouts even with my hormones going crazy from pregnancy and it does wonders for keeping shine at bay in my t-zone while not over drying the rest of my face. I should mentioned I have combo skin and tend to have a very oily t-zone but normal-dry cheeks. I only use this is the AM followed by a vitamin c serum and moisturizer. It has a bit of a sulfur smell but hey what do you expect from a cleanser that has sulfur as an active ingredient? The smell doesn’t linger on your face but can linger on your device if you use one to wash your face. I use the FOREO Luna 3 and have to make sure I rinse all the cleanser out after each wash to keep the smell away. This is definitely a product I will continue to buy even after I can use salicylic acid again, it is just so good!\n",

I just received the product yesterday morning. I love it so far! It smells good and makes my skin feel so fresh and clear! I’m only on day 2 of it! Love this cleanser. Started with a mini size and bought the full size after.Removes makeup well and skin doesn’t feel dry afterwards. The smell is divine and after using it, my skin is soft and clear. You don't need to wash your face again with another cleanser afterwards. This is the only cleansing balm that I have found that does not burn my sensitive eyes. This is very gentle, a nice thick balm that almost liquefies on contact with the skin. It does emulsify but I use it as recommended with the muslin cloth to wipe it off. If I use just the cleansing balm by itself my skin feels a bit dry afterwards. I always follow up with my Clarisonic and a water-based cleanser afterwards anyways so for me it’s not a problem. I enjoy the smell very much, it smells very natural, herbal, and spa like to me. This does a good job removing my long lasting sunblock. I would recommend this for people who do wear a lot of make up and are looking for a gentle balm cleanser following up with a water-based cleanser afterwards. I would also recommend this to people who don’t wear make up to be used alone as a nourishing facial cleanser. I am extremely acne prone and this has not broken me out or clogged my pores.

The muslin is really key too as I was attempting to create a shortcut by skipping that step but honestly it was a waste of my time. The muslin makes this both a regular cleanser and a light exfoliant but not irritating to anyone with sensitive concerns. I find I like the kind of herby/grassy smell, it works when you follow the instructions and create a little mini facial thing there with the pressure points and whatever.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would! I have extremely dry, flaky skin and this made my skin softer than butter. The granules are not too abrasive and the smell is divine. I will repurchase again and again! Fresh, promise me you’ll never change the formula! Love love this product! It exfoliates extremely well and leaves my face baby soft and glowing. I have sensitive skin and I will say that it is a tad harsh and leaves my face red after, but I use it before bed so it’s not a big deal. Also the smell is sugary lemon which I adore! I recommend for sure! I feel like I don’t need to leave a review, you’ve said it all. Best exfoliator on the market. Hands down best exfoliator I’ve ever used!!!! Wish it came in a huge jar. Smells amazing and god does it leave your skin soft and moisturized. If you wanted to skip your skin care routine after using this you can feel confident that your face is moisturized. Really like the feel and texture of the product. Leaves the skin soft and dewy! I can use it a couple times a week without any issues even tho I have sensitive skin! Looooove this. Smells so good and leaves your skin really soft ❤️ This product is gentle enough that I use it at least 5x per week. I use the Fresh Soy Face Cleanser first and then I apply this right after and leave for 10-15 minutes. I love how it makes my face feel so soft and clean afterwards! I sometimes will use this in the morning to exfoliate my face before I put on my foundation because it helps my foundation to be applied smoother. Okay, so I´ve seen some bad reviews on this thing so I got the mini to try it out since I never exfoliate and realized I needed to start doing it and I didn´t have high expectations but oh my god, it works so much better than I thought it would´ve. First of all, it seems so freaking good and you don´t even need to use a lot of it so the mini is lasting me a long time. And maybe this is because the only other exfoliator I have ever used is that Kate Somerville one but years ago so I don´t know that much about them, but I saw the difference right away, like no kidding. Before I even washed it off, my face looked so much brighter and glowy, it's crazy. And afterward, my entire face was so incredibly smooth that I couldn't stop feeling my face. And I don't know but my face just looks so much better and like new and fresh. So you definitely definitelyyyy need to try this one out, especially if you´re new to exfoliators.\n",

It's super easy to apply and my favorite part is when you wash it off. The sugary texture exfoliates your skin just enough as you wash it off and completely melts away! Your skin is super soft afterwards, proving how efficient the exfoliation works! I love this product for weekly exfoliation. My skin feels so soft after This is a gentle exfolitor and it is not too grainy and rough on my sensitive skin. This makes your face so smooth and soft. I’ve been using this cleanser for over 10 years now. I love the all PTR skin cleansers and exfoliating face and body washes. I’ve tried others for over the years used them intermittently but none of the other cleaners come close to the PTR cleansing products. The results are outstanding with or without the use of manual exfoliating tools (washcloths, Clarisonic etc) which is impressive. I would have thought by now my skin would have adapted to the products and there’d be a plateau of some sort, but that hasn’t happened. It’s a miracle in a bottle, clears the blemishes/acne, unevenness in tone, even helps with elasticity! WORTH IT!\n",
      "…read more Forever my favorite cleanser. Ive been using this cleanser for 12 years now. As I’ve gotten older my skin has become more sensitive so I can’t use it every day like before when it was more oily/acne prone. I use it 2 times a week now. I love the smell and love that a drop goes a long way. Love how it brightens and tightens my skin every time. Thus cleansing gel is phenomenal. I’ve used so many different cleaners and every time there was something lacking in one aspect or the other. I received a sample size of thus and proceeded to buy the full size after one week. My skin has been clearer, more vibrant, refined and overall balanced. I have combination/oily skin - some dry patches and others are normal. This is the first facial cleanser that has checked off all my requirements. The smell is light and feminine and this is my favorite part of my skincare routine.\n",
      "…read more Refreshing way to cleanse your skin! I use it daily and love the way it brightens my skin. I have tried multiple face washes over the years and I keep coming back to this one. My husband actually uses every day now too! We keep 1 in the shower and 1 by our sink so we both use this 2x a day. I do notice a difference when I try something else for a month or so. Buy this product, you won’t regret it! The bottle lasts a very long time. Loving this cleanser. It’s a little bit drying so you have to be careful how often you use it. But my skin looks even and fresh for the past month I’ve been using. My most favorite cleanser. Takes off all makeup and mascara. Very gentle. Use this with Clarisonic or wash cloth and it leaves my skin clean without overly dried out. So worth the money. The only cleansing gel I would use. Amazing cleansing gel, this product clean really well, and make my skin glow and soft. I also use this cleanser as a body wash! Loves it This was given to me as a gift so I decided to try it. I have rosacea and sensitive skin so I thought this might be too harsh. It was in the shower for me to use once a week as an exfoliator until I switched it to my every-day cleanser. That’s when I noticed how nice my skin started to look. It doesn’t strip my face or leave it tight feeling but I do have to moisturize afterwards. But my skin has become poreless. I even am seeing my fine lines less. This product works for me. Be careful because it does have acids that will strip your face and one could end up over exfoliating. I don’t use any other exfoliating product because it’s too harsh for my skin. So this cleanser, the PTR rentinol And a thick moisturizer twice a day and I have Sansa Stark skin. I’ll be buying this for myself once I’m done with what I have.\n",

I haven't been too fussy about my skincare routine until recently, when I figured I'm getting older (over 40), so I had better start caring! I bought this, hoping for a gentle but effective cleanser. My skin has literally never been so soft. A little goes a long way and my skin feels clean, definitely not dry, and lovely afterwards. I'm sticking with it. I bought this facewash because of the review that says she wanted to date it. I was not disappointed. No breakouts and gentle. Make sure the cap is tight or it will spill everywhere. My skin is so clear since using this face wash. Haven’t broken out or any irritations. I love Kiehls products and needs a new face wash. This does the job- nice foaming action, light scent and a little goes a long way! Good size for the price too. Highly recommend! I love this line of products at kiehls. The cleanser, toner and moisturizer work perfectly for my skin. I have oily skin and the gel/cream like texture of the cleanser washes away everything even most makeup. Usually not intense waterproof makeup but it will wash away foundation and powders. My ALL-TIME favorite face wash. It’s so gentle, great for sensitive skin, and ALWAYS gets my makeup off. It is my go-to skincare item I have combination skin and I’ve had pesky bumps on my forehead forehead for YEARS. I’ve tried lines for all kinds of skin but surprisingly, this worked the best for me. Within 24 hours, my forehead is about 50% clearer. I used it in conjunction with the toner and the face cream and I’m thrilled with my results! I have combination skin and this cleanser has been amazing. I've been using it for a few weeks. It doesn't dry out my skin and makes it feel so clean. I love this! Will definitely buy another once this one runs out. Very simple cleanser, but does the job and did a great job of not making my skin dry I've been trying to find a cleanser that really worked for me and this is it!!! Super gentle and gets a lot of my dirt from my pores out. Also good for removing makeup! Great cleanser! I use this with the rest of the line - toner, moisturizer, and creamy eye treatment. All of it works wonders together! The cleanser is perfect because it doesn’t over dry. I feel like the headline I’ve left for all these products is - a little goes a long way, and its so true. I literally use a drop of this on my vanity facial brush. I love it because I use very little of all of these products, which means I’ll have them for awhile. ;)\n",

I have dry skin and this feels amazing and never dries out my face. I highly recommended and plan on using this as a daily cleanser.\n",

I’m so surprised more people aren’t talking about this. The price is a bit steep, but it lasts a really long time! I’ve had it for about two months and have barely made a dent. At first it seemed like it was drying me out, but I hung in there and wow! My skin has been so smooth and it’s definitely been fading some dullness and dark spots! Will repurchase for sure. This product really works well. It removes makeup and improves my skin. This is the first SK-II product I've tried and will be purchasing other products from them. The best cleanser around! Worth the money! always on my to buy list always keep one in stock. it is the one that never goes wrong.nothing good nothing bad so i keep looking for other selection but come back for it finally. Love this cleanser. It’s so gentle yet tough where it needs to be. Love the smell too! So fresh and clean. Just used this for the first time and never want to be without it! It is rich and luxurious feeling and foams up a treat using only a small amount. I really really love this line of skin care and wish I’d found it years ago It's a very gentle but effective cleanser. The ingredients are very simple with amino acids base and willow bark (natural BHA) to purify pores. A great daily cleanser for normal- dry skin types. I personally think it works best with the Foreo tool! I fell in love with this face wash after the first week of using it! I have textured adult acne prone skin and this face wash has helped not only with the texture of my skin but with my acne too. It's definitely pricey but I use less than a dime sized amount and it does the job. I also bought the SK II welcome kit which I use in conjunction with this product. This scrub has changed my skincare game completely! I use it about 3x’s a week and my skin has never looked better!! My fine lines are drastically softer, dark spots are so subtle I can hardly see them, Finally an exfoliating product that isn't too harsh! This stuff works incredibly well and leaves my face feeling soft and even. I use it about 2x a week. Makes all of my other products go on much smoother. You can literally see and feel the dead skin coming off, but it’s not super harsh feeling. Scrub a dub dub love it This is SO good. I recently got a series of professional, albeit mild, chemical peels and this makes my skin even softer than the professional ones. My skin is acne-prone, oily and REALLY sensitive, but it works wonders! I doesn’t irritate my face and leave me with soft skin. Will definitely repurchase! I really love using this peel twice a week. I feel so smooth and refreshed after. I rub it all over for a full minute at least and find that it really gets in there. Love it! Removes all dead skin and leaves your skin baby butt soft! This product is a wonderful way to gently exfoliate your skin! It’s not harsh or irritating at all, has no scent, and never breaks me out (a lot of skincare does). My skin feels super smooth and soft afterward. Highly recommended if you want a physical exfoliator that won’t damage your skin in any way. This is a go to for me when I feel like my skin is full of junk! It clears my skin instantly! absolutely love this, used it for the first time tonight and oh lordy did it ever make my skin feel so soft!!!! I switched to this from the Secret Key Lemon Peel (Amazon) to stick with clean ingredients.. and I was not disappointed. I really ejoy the feel of this product, and I love the feel of my skin after. I use this three times a week in the morning just before I hop in the shower... it's wonderful. IT piles nicely, and it takes very little manual pressure to work. In fact, I use a very very delicate pressure when rubbing this on my face, and let the product do all the work. My skin always looks and feels amazing after. I recommend this for everyone.

Gently exfoliate my sensitive skin. I usually use Dr Brants scrub and was looking for something to alternate with. Since I use many Clinique products, this was a natural choice. I don’t regret it at all, it works like a dream and my skin feels great! I have sensitive skin and can’t use a lot of products with out it stripping layers around my nose of skin off and this product does no such thing. I can enjoy exfoliating my skin again! AMAZING product!! I have tried so many exfoliating face cleansers but this one is by far the best. Right after the first wash I saw a huge difference in the look and feel of my face. As mentioned in previous reviews, the scrub has that minty/cool feel while washing and I LOVE THAT! 100% would recommend! Definitely give it a try, you won’t regret it. This product has lasted me about 4 month with very frequent use, about 3 times weekly. Not only does it have a wonderful cooling affect which is nice to wake you up in the morning, but it also does the best job ever at clearing out pores. This product is rough without being too rough for frequent use and you really can't beat the price for what you get! I have used countless scrubs... COUNTLESS! Alas, I have found The One. It doesn't make my finicky skin breakout or dry out. I got a little oily the first couple times after using it, but after incorporating a moisturizer it was smoooooth sailing. Bonus: my makeup looks so much better after a good sluffing with this exfoliating scrub! my forever favourite scrub. it is super grainy and my face feels like a baby's butt afterwards. products go on so much better and my skin always feels so much better after i use it. have tried other scrubs, but none of them work as well as this one - i always come back. the best. Love this product works amazing on my skin and I feel so refreshed after using it. Definitely needs to be followed with a moisturizer though cause it will dry out your skin. I have sensitive, allergy-prone skin. Before I found Clinique, I would often react to skincare products, particularly mascara, lip products, facial cleansers, and makeup remover. So if you have similar issues, I would highly recommend Clinique products. Regarding this exfoliating scrub, the biggest thing I noticed was it felt good to use this product as it didn't feel like it took my skin away, but instead cleared things from my skin, such as my blackheads. It works very well, and my skin loves it too!\n",

I came back to my holy grail that has helped with my dry patches in the past, and after 2 weeks of use, my pigmentation has lightened. It cleans very well, my face feels minty fresh.

Was afraid the cool tingly feeling it gave would burn my sensitive skin but it did a good job of exfoliating without overdrying. At first I didn’t know whether to apply on dry skin but I still did it. Then added a tiny bit of water then worked the product in. It felt good during and felt good after. I had an aunt (who’s a dermatologist) that recommended me this brand. I’ve tried this scrub and is FANTASTIC! I use it at night before going to sleep because my face gets very oily (I work in a kitchen) and it feels so refreshing after I use it! Love this! I like gritty scrubs like this, usually use every other day or so. (Daily I use the Clinique 3 step skin care) I have sensitive skin and I get occasional breakouts on my chin, this has helped with that as well. For the longest time I just used drug store face scrubs because of the lower price but feel this had better results over all. Not the best for removing makeup. I prefer to use these after I cleanse my face or as a pick me up in the morning. These are a second time purchase, and are my favorite cleansing cloths. Unlike a lot of cleansing cloths, which merely removes the make up and dirt, these I believe are an actual \"treatment\" to my face. Besides, they smell fabulous which almost makes them worth it just for that! Really nice for what they do. The top clicks easily shut. The clothes definitely hold a lot of moisture until the end. They work well and smell on the sweeter side (which I like, but I can see how they'd be too sweet for some). Makes for an easy face wipe when I want to freshen up after the gym. My husband and I love these for nights when you’re tired or feeling lazy. He has oily skin (that has balanced with Ole for oily skin) and I have dry skin. I love these wipes! They work great, the seal is better than 99% out there and I've had no negative reactions to them. OLEHENRIKSEN has become one of my favorite brands; I love the products they make. Great product! Leaves my skin clean and refreshed and smells amazeballs! Smells amazing. Makeup remover, face cleanser, and face serum all in one!!! Great for on the go or for traveling! Works well. Quick way to clean and refresh your face in a rush. Scent is strong but enjoyable. I love these wipes! The scent is so refreshing and the texture is just right for getting that fresh wiped clean-face-feeling. This was the first “vitamin c” containing product I ever used and I swear they really do make my skin glow/more bright! I love these. They are a staple in my collection. They smell like orange creamsicles. This is my go to facial wipe! Works like a dream and smells fantastic. I love these cleansing wipes. Great for getting makeup off and skin feels clean and refreshed. I have never written a review for a product in my life, however, this was a complete and utter game changer for me. My skin is nothing short of temperamental and this cleanser has TRANSFORMED it. It has prevented dryness without causing buildup in my pores and changed the overall texture of my skin. It is softer and less blotchy than it has ever been. I bought this on a whim after Sephora was out of my usual Origins product in the local store and I will never go back! I have been using it for about five months now and I’m excited to get my hands on the other Farmacy products.\n",

Cold, windy and dry and my cheeks and jawline are peeling? Say no more!!! I even got my husband to start using it and he won’t use any other face wash now.

Two pumps is the ideal amount to wash your face - anything more would be excessive. As its name would suggest, it is quite gentle and feels smooth to the touch without any strong smells.

It is my holy grail and staple in my skin care products! I have acne prone combination skin so this is perfect! It's clean and minimally fragrant (smells like tumeric and honey) so you know it's safe or your skin! It cleans my face fine, is gentle as it claims. Non-comodogenic.

I noticed a difference in how smooth my skin feels. I don’t use it daily because my skin develops dry patches because it’s too strong for me. I did like how much better my skin looks just using it minimally and it does make my face feel really clean afterwards. I also like that it’s a nice consistency not watery or goooy, and there is no strong smell. I have struggled with dry/sensitive skin that is prone to redness my whole life. I have mild eczema, and I have struggled for years to find an exfoliating wash that doesn't leave me extra dry or red. This is the only one I have consistently repurchased. The exfoliating beads are small and delicate, but there are tons of them. You can't directly see them in the product because they are so fine, but you really feel them working. The base of the product is also great, it is similar to Cetaphil or CeraVe gentle face washes, so the product exfoliates but does not over dry or strip the skin. It is very light, with minimal scent. I can even use this product in the fall and winter when my skin is at its most dry and red. I've recommended this product to tons of friends, and they all thank me for it.\n",

I love the microbeads and how smooth it makes my skin feel. I have oily skin that's not very sensitive so it works well for me. It beats all the drug-store brands I've used.

Very effective physical exfoliator - I keep it in my travel cosmetics bag and it’s lasted for ages! Will definitely buy again. I don’t recommend using this product more than once or twice a week.

I used this previously but started using a drugstore alternative that had basically all of the same ingredients. After 6 months i’m back to using this. Using the cheaper one gave me so many blackheads all over my face. I’m not sure what is in this that works but it’s awesome! I’m not sure if Murad Time Release cured my acne or the cleanser combined with my other skincare regimen did the work but my face is completely acne free.

Little background:Asian, fair skin, oily but dehydrated skin and very sensitive and acne prone skin. My entire face was covered with acne beginning of last year. And then I started murad time release because it’s much gentler on my skin and doesn’t leave it dry.

I’m not sure if Murad Time Release cured my acne or the cleanser combined with my other skincare regimen did the work but my face is completely acne free. Even that I’m acne free, I still keep murad in my regimen, I am now on my fourth tube of time release cleanser. Little background:Asian, fair skin, oily but dehydrated skin and very sensitive and acne prone skin. My entire face was covered with acne beginning of last year. And then I started murad time release because it’s much gentler on my skin and doesn’t leave it dry. I also incorporated hydraulic acid toner, and barrier repair cream morning and night, Korean mask sheets every other nights. Now my face is smooth and acne free—- Thank you Murad, I will always keep you as part of my skincare\n",

I have sensitive hormonal acne and combo skin, so it is hard to find products that tackle all the ‘concerns’ without making me break out. This stuff though, love it. I have been using this daily for over a year and have no intention of changing. I have/had dry skin but using this everyday for almost a month has changed the way my skin feels. Nicest toner I have ever used! Well worth it! I’ve been using this toner for a couple of weeks now. What I love about it most is that it does not dry out my super dry skin. My husband uses it, too, and loves it. It’s not expensive and it’s a huge bottle. 100% will purchase again if it ever runs out! I have normal to oil skin and use it mornings after wash my face and my skin feels really good, I use it direct on my skin without a pad This toner is amazing! It has helped my skin so much and my skin is super sensitive. Love it and it’s amazing for the price. Great toner for hydration purposes only. The texture is milky, and absorption is quick. It leaves the skin soft and hydrated. Serums and oils glide on easily after prepped with this toner. Great price point. However, if you’re looking for a multitasking toner (exfoliating, brightening, anti-oxidative), this may not be for you. Again, strictly for hydration. This toner has worked WONDERS on my face! I have big visible pores on my cheeks, and this toner has really resurfaced all of that. I don’t know exactly how it works, but what I do know is that my face looks smoother, younger, and flawless once I put the makeup on. ;) Same as the ultra facial cleanser from Kiehl’s, this stuff is great for everyday use that’s nothing super fancy but definitely does the trick! It’s almost a milky consistency which is very gentle for sensitive skin like mine, and super hydrating. Scent free, for those who like that. Most importantly, it doesn’t contain alcohol which is all I need in a toner to keep coming back for more! Pros: •absorbs quickly into skin •a little goes a very long way •price is affordable •skin is more hydrated, even and smoother after constant and frequent use Cons: •after awhile, your results plateau After using this toner for weeks on my combo/oily skin morning and night, I have noticed improved hydration and more even skin tone. Texture has been reduced as well. It’s gentle but does the job right. Results are not spectacular but they are noticeable and the price for the amount you get can’t be beat. Especially for how long this can last even when using twice a day.\n",
      "…read more My skin always felt so dry after washing it, even though I was using a really gentle cleanser and a hydrating moisturizer. Adding this toner in made a drastic difference. If I don’t use it before i moisturize, my skin feels tight and dry. I didn’t realize a toner could make such a difference! I love this toner. I have really dry skin and this is so creamy and non drying. My skin feels so refreshed after I use it. Awesome. Moisturizing and makes my pores disappear. A great neutral toner! I use this consistently and my skin feels smoother and more even. I know i can count on this toner and will definitely buy again I love this cleanser. If doesn’t take much and lasts quite awhile. For some crazy reason, since I’ve left SoCal, the scent takes me home to Newport Beach Fashion Island. Since I cleanse with Bioderma micellar water in the a.m., It’s not been drying for me at all. I’ve loved using this product to control my extremely oily skin. Before, I was told to use oil free products since my skin overly produces oil. I gave this a shot because I use the all-day balancing serum and had a great experience with that. To begin, you only need a rain drop of the product to use. It’s extremely dense which makes a little go a long way. The odor smells so clean and fresh that it doesn’t give you a headache - and truly leaves your skin feeling great. Would recommend to anyone trying to get a new skincare routine - especially for oily skin.\n",
      "…read more Amazing cleanser! I’ve tried to many and prefer the foam but it usually leaves my skin feeling dry. This foams nicely, great scent and doesn’t dry my skin out at all. I use this with my foreo and a little goes a long way. I think it’s a great value for the product due to how little I would need to use. Wow, I bought the sampler kit for $75 and this is the BEST foaming face wash. I have used so many other K brands and this one is the best. I will not use another brand again, this one is for life. I love amorepacific's products, especially this cleanser! It's perfect because it's not harsh yet cleans the skin effectively. I just love the way my skin feels after. I pair it with the moisturebound serum and hydra gel moisturizer and the new skincare regimen has been so good for keeping my acne at bay. I will also say that the 4 oz. lasts foreverrrrr, seriously a little bit goes a long way! I live in a tropical climate, so it works for me to cleanse in both AM/PM. I use this in the morning and the enzyme cleansing powder in the evening. Works well for me! Love this cleanser. Just a tiny amount easily dissolves all of my makeup and leaves my face feeling super clean but not dry . Very good cleaner. Cleaned well and makes my skin feel great Love it! A tiny bit goes a long way. Leaves my face clean with drying it out. Feels awesome after I use it. So worth the price. For a long time, I refused to spend money for pricey cleansers, choosing to spend more on the products I would leave on my skin instead. Amorepacific made me change my ways. I double cleanse using the oil cleanser followed by the cleansing foam, and love how clean and fresh my skin feels after washing. Gentle, but effective. And a little goes a very long way! One of my favorite cleansers. I’ve been using this product for at least 8 years. It’s gentle enough for my sensitive skin. Amorepacific is a great brand and I use a lot of their products. Keeps my oily skin at bay and is a must have staple in my skin care routine. Love! Don't let the price deter you from trying this amazing cleanser! I know it's marketed for all skin types, but I only would suggest it for combo or oily skin because it's on that borderline of leaving your skin too dry. I use about a pea-sized amount of cleanser, and I feel like I have a huge face (most of it my forehead lol), and I get a great lather and full on cleanse for all this square footage of face. My husband has normal skin, and he uses this also, but he's recently complained that he feels drier than usual; therefore, my caution above. I've been using this cleanser for about a year now, and I haven't had such soft, clear skin before. Sure my skin wasn't horrible before because I've been using great skincare for 12 years now, but this was a much-needed upgrade in my routine. I also use the AmorePacific cleansing oil for my double cleanse routine when I wear heavy and/or water resistant makeup, so when I do that, this gets used second.\n",
      "…read more My favorite face cleanser ever! Smells great, feels rich and moisturizing! Lightly exfoliating. My breakouts have reduced greatly. Worth every penny! I bought this cleanser for my (fairly skeptical) husband, and he loves it! I noticed his face looking brighter after just a few days, and our family members have noticed that it even reduces the prominence of his acne scars. The product itself feels very light and clean, and I'm looking forward to getting it for myself when my current cleanser runs out! My go to wash. Really removes makeup from your pores. I do two washes to be sure if I have a heavier makeup day. Doesn’t overly dry skin. Looks clean and refreshed after washing. Best cleanser hands down. The only cleanser that cleans every spec of makeup off. I have been struggling with acne for the past few years and didn’t think anything would work to clear it up. I’ve been using this cleanser consistently for a few months now and am so incredibly happy! I haven’t had any large breakouts and any small blackhead I get is super easy to extract. So excited that I tried this product :) This is the best cleaner for getting a cleaner skin after applying makeup. Gets rid of all the residue & also mascara which used to be a big issue for me. But for years I’ve been using this product & it really helps. Love this product! I’ve suffered with acne prone skin all my adult life so I am very cautious of the products that I use. After being on meds and proactive- good product, just not effective for when you’re approaching the middle age mark, I bought this product for weekend use, when the makeup comes off and I wanted something softer on my skin, to give my skin a rest from the daily beat. It’s amazingly cleansing and gentle. I don’t have any fear for breakouts and the blemishes I do have are not so pronounced. I will definitely purchase this product again.\n",
      "…read more This peel gel seriously saved me. My whole life I had the worst oily, yet dry and very flaky skin. I would always have noticeable flakes on my nose and forehead area. NOTHING helped it. I mean, I didn’t really invest in skin care and I would try to go for the more affordable “amazing” products. But now I’m glad I made the choice to seriously invest. Everything I picked out, I did so much research on (who wants to waste money when they’re buying a whole skincare routine at once.) and I don’t regret any of it. ESPECIALLY this one! I will address the issues I see in some reviews: Yes, this is hard to wash off. But it’s worth it. I’m not sure if it actually gets clumped in peach fuzz, I purposely got a little in my eyebrow and scalp to test it out and it didn’t cling to little hairs at all. I seriously observed all of the action as I’ve used this the past couple weeks and from what I can see, I’ve come to the conclusion that this product actually clumps up in my dead skin, which is actually a good thing because it shows that it’s really clinging to it and doing great with removing it. So that whole debate on if the little clumps are dead skin or the product itself? I think it’s both. So, remember I said how my skin was this gross oily flaky texture? Nothing would help it. It got to the point where I was willing to use a washcloth to try and rub the flakes off and id scrub it pretty hard. I was so sick of my skin that I was willing to damage it. Which still didn’t even help. No exfoliation’s, toners, face cleansers, nothing. The very first night I used this, the amount of clumps that I saw was insane! (they reduced over time as my skin came to life)But what was even more shocking was that once I rinsed this off, literally ALL of my oiliness, dryness, and flakiness instantly vanished. My skin immediately became baby smooth. It was actually emotional for me because it was the best my skin has ever looked in my life. My skin never gets annoyingly flaky now.\n",

Once you look past that, this stuff is amazing. I always feel like after using this I've gotten off that rough top layer of skin. My face is always baby smooth after using this.

Anyways, I went into Sephora just looking for an exfoliator to deal with sebum and dry skin and an associate recommended this product to me. At this point, I had totally forgotten about the dead skin under my eyes until I used it and looked in the mirror and the dead skin was gone!

Definitely going to buy a full size!\n",
      "…read more This was recommended to me while in the store and, as a dry skin sufferer in Midwest winters, it does make a big difference in removing flakey skin. When I see dry patches or places where my foundation is not smooth, I use it and it is fantastic. Also, the smell is not overwhelming - some product smells really bother me. This is a great exfoliant. I was using Kate Somerville “exfolikate” which i think is amazing. This one works better for my skin. My skin has never been so clear. I do have to take a facecloth to remove debris left on skin. I’m also using boscia makeup-breakup and purifying cleansing gel. Im very happy with all three products. I’ve used this for years. Not only can you see this working, but it feels amazing afterwords. If you’re super dry, like I’ve been, it can be used daily until necessary. This is a staple product in my skin care. Love this!!! Does not irritate my skin and leaves it feeling so so smooth! I also love that it is a clean product with no weird chemicals! Love this product!! Really different feeling type of clean after using. Feels like it sheds all of the dead skin off, really good!! having sensitive skin in normal climes, and now living in harsh Midwest winters, my skin is extremely sensitive. This product is AMAZING. Absolutely no burning, but does an excellent job of removing dead skin cells, leaving only smooth and refreshed skin. Don't let the reviews about pilling and getting caught in peach fuzz deter you from trying this product. The peach fuzz balls remove easily with warm water, and the more you use the product the less it gets caught in facial hair. The pilling up is part of the exfoliant process - think of using balled up glue to remove residual glue, and that's pretty much what happens with this product and your skin. Again, this product is AMAZING. Try it!\n",

      "…read more This was recommended to me while in the store and, as a dry skin sufferer in Midwest winters, it does make a big difference in removing flakey skin. When I see dry patches or places where my foundation is not smooth, I use it and it is fantastic. Also, the smell is not overwhelming - some product smells really bother me. This is a great exfoliant. I was using Kate Somerville “exfolikate” which i think is amazing. This one works better for my skin. My skin has never been so clear. I do have to take a facecloth to remove debris left on skin. I’m also using boscia makeup-breakup and purifying cleansing gel. Im very happy with all three products. I’ve used this for years. Not only can you see this working, but it feels amazing afterwords. If you’re super dry, like I’ve been, it can be used daily until necessary. This is a staple product in my skin care. Love this!!! Does not irritate my skin and leaves it feeling so so smooth! I also love that it is a clean product with no weird chemicals! Love this product!! Really different feeling type of clean after using. Feels like it sheds all of the dead skin off, really good!! having sensitive skin in normal climes, and now living in harsh Midwest winters, my skin is extremely sensitive. This product is AMAZING. Absolutely no burning, but does an excellent job of removing dead skin cells, leaving only smooth and refreshed skin. Don't let the reviews about pilling and getting caught in peach fuzz deter you from trying this product. The peach fuzz balls remove easily with warm water, and the more you use the product the less it gets caught in facial hair. The pilling up is part of the exfoliant process - think of using balled up glue to remove residual glue, and that's pretty much what happens with this product and your skin. Again, this product is AMAZING. Try it!\n",
      "…read more I've used this when I'm in a pinch and don't have my regular face wash. It doesn't feel drying or like it's stripping your face of everything. My husband loves this stuff and is on his 4th bottle. No break outs or redness with use. Fair warning though, neither of us break out with niacinamide, however if you are sensitive, do not purchase. Niacinamide does to work for everyone. Some do break out from it. My husband loves this and he has been washing his face with a bar soap all this while. I cringed and died a little inside when I found out so I bought him this out of a whim and he's on his second bottle now. Great ingredient list, nourishing and non-drying. My husband has normal skin and not sensitive. My brother always ask me to restock this for him whenever there's a VIB Rouge sale. He swears this is the best cleanser he has used which helped with his acne and clearer skin. He no longer have breakouts since using this. He noticed a difference within weeks and have been using this day and night for 2 years now. I bought this product for my husband when he was having some sporadic breakouts. After a few uses, his face cleared up nicely. I went into sephora to talk to someone about getting a cleanser that worked to remove the light daily makeup I wear for work. I was told that there weren't any cleansers did the job perfectly, I'd just have to accept a double cleanse routine of some sort. Well lady you were WRONG!!! I got a sample of this cleanser and two others to try out, gave this one a go when I got home and there was nothing left on my skin when I went in afterwards with a micellar water. No mascara, no mineral foundation. Wasn't super foamy and didn't leave my skin feeling really stripped afterwards which was nice (wasn't exactly hydrating but better than a lot of foaming cleansers I've tried). I'd guess this wouldn't take off everything if you wear lots of makeup, but this absolutely exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "…read more LOVE this product and I stand by it! Will never use any other cleanser! Didn’t even make me break out or have an allergic reaction like most cleansers do. Love the fresh smell and how clean my face feels afterwards. My husband loves this product particularly in the winter when his skin is drier. My only complaint is that this is the second Jack Black product sent mail order that has had a broken or missing part to the pump. Would highly recommend that they package the pump separately in a box separate from the product with a lid on the bottle that can be replaced with the pump upon delivery. Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. He was breaking out a bit just from not washing his face, but ever since he started using this, his face is clear! I also use it when I'm at his place. It's not drying and doesn't leave your face feeling tight, but also doesn't make it feel oily. Perfect balance! I bought this for my boyfriend last year and he uses it daily and has great skin. It lasts a super long time too I only just now had to buy another one. I got the larger size. I really like that this product doesn't use parabens, phthalates or sulfates too. I bought this last year to get my skin in check for my wedding and it was great. I struggle with acne and this really left my skin feeling smooth. I prefer a toner that has an ingredient to treat acne so salicylic acid in it is great. Only thing is it did kinda run out quickly I love this stuff, it’s part of my daily routine to use this in the morning and at night. It’s done everything I could ask it to do. Awesome! I have acne prone areas all over my chin and around my mouth, before using this product I would notice a new big, painful, under the skin bump coming in every few days. After using this for a couple weeks I noticed I rarely have new breakouts - only once in a while now, and much less severe! It also works to exfoliate the skin. My face feels much smoother than it did before. It’s a bit drying and can burn my face a little but a good moisturizer will fix that! The overall look and feel of my skin has improved so much from using this paired with the Acne Solutions Foaming Cleanser.\n",

I'm in love with Sunday Riley. I love to switch my products up but I always come back to this cleanser at some point. WELL, after my last cleanser totally messed up my face, I am back to Ceramic Slip and NEVER LEAVING!!!! Truly my skin looked better, less red, and overall balanced within 2 uses. Love this cleanser and the new packaging. a very gentle cleanser, doesn’t totally strip your skin, leaves skin feeling soft and clean I haven't tried the original formula, but i am very happy with this product. I am suffering from hormonal acne while being pregnant and i noticed a difference in my skin after a few times of using this. Yes, it's not a miracle and it hasn't gotten rid of every blemish i have, but this has helped a lot! I will definitely repurchase this in the future. No offense, but i don't think it deserves all the hate with a lot of other reviews on here.\n",
      "…read more Great product, it makes my skin feel so clean afterwards without stripping its moisture or being harsh. It’s very gentle I use it as a second cleanser when I double cleanse to get deep in my pore without any irritation. The only issue is the packaging, it should be in a pump dispenser. I can't say enough about how much I love this cleanser. I have been dealing with hormonal acne for over 2 years now. My aesthetician told me I was overdoing it: drying out my skin and over exfoliating. This cleanser brought balance to my skin, it does really cleanse but it never strips my skin plus it makes my skin glow! Will definitely keep purchasing :) This smells beautiful and leaves my skin silky soft and does not dry out my skin. This exfoliator feels amazing, it does a great job of removing all dead skin and my skin feels refreshed after using. The smell is SO amazing I would rebuy it even if it doesn't work! It's a light and refreshing smell. Will definitely buy again! Also, reasonably priced for the amount. Makes my face soooo smooth I can’t stop touching it after using it. Smells really nice and fresh. The only thing I don’t like is that it says to use twice a week and I’m so tempted to use it everyday because my skin feels softer than a baby’s. I’m extremely acne prone and this did not cause any acne, I feel as though it actually calmed some of the acne I had when I used it. I am completely in shock and 100% satisfied. I have been struggling with extreme oil, dryness around my nose, and ugly texture on my chin. This product has truly solved all my issues in one use. I have tried product after product both drugstore and prestige brands. I 100% recommend this product if you are reading this review try it!!! I guarantee it will change your life!!! I started with they’re eye cream and loved it I am now updating my skincare to everything FRESH.\n",

I have very sensitive skin but this scrub washes away all the oil/dirt on my face without irritated my skin. Fresh is an amazing brand. I love buying it. The smell is amazing. The result is amazing. All around an amazing product. Def worth the money! Not only did this exfoliator shed ever millimeter of my dead skin cells...it shedded away my sins and gave my face a fresh start at life like a new born baby fresh out of the womb. 10/10 highly recommend, especially for sensitive skin too because my skin is just as sensitive as my emotions. God literally forgave me and my face as I bought and applied this impeccable product. I adore this product. I use it about twice a week. It's a really gentle exfoliator that does wonders to my dry, sensitive skin. I used to breakout quite a lot and thanks to using this little gem I don't have to worry about breakouts anymore. I also love the fresh, earthy scent of this scrub. I usually use it in the PM. I massage it in, and leave for a couple minutes before washing it away with lukewarm water. This along with the Clarins Blue Orchid Face Oil are the two products that revolutionized my skincare routine.\n",

However now that I’m not pregnant anymore and I’m back to my normal skin it’s a bit drying for me and caused some redness on my cheeks ( I have sensitive skin on my cheeks) I have tried neutrogena's exfoliator before. It was horrible my face turned bright red with large lumps forming. I decided I really needed to try out a different one as of more recently I have been flaking on my forehead. I used this only once and after a few seconds of rubbing it in I saw dead skin rolling of my face I was so amazed! I will admit I was scared because this exfoliant is a little rough but worth it. After I rinsed my face I felt so smooth and soft! I will be adding this to my skincare musts! I'm in LOVE.\n",

My skin really absorbs all the moisturizer and I don’t feel like I have a layer of grossness on my skin anymore. It’s drying and if you scrub too hard everything will burn pretty hardcore after. Lightly exfoliated and used great moisturizer and I notice a difference already When I had foundation on I was able to see build up. When I washed my face I couldn’t see it. I got this product to see if it helped with the deep cleaning. It did more then what I expected with in the same week I noticed my T zone improving. LOVEEEEE THIS! i have oily, acne prone, uneven texture/ discoloration. and even though after a scrub face can be a bit red, it is not damaging, not drying nor stripping. Face feels smooth after and days on. I use ever 2-3days. Use it on my shoulders and chest due to this warm weather and sweat. to help prevent any little pimp. Sooooo good. Gets in really deep I love it makes my skin feels really good and smooth Love Love Love - My skin comes out so smooth everytime I use it! A really great exfoliant on the natural side. Definitely read the instructions before using: keep it away from eyes and should not massage into the face for more than thirty seconds to avoid irritation. Other than that it's great for all skin types, and a little goes a long way so the product will last for a while! this is my favorite cleanser , i normally mixed this with kiehl calendula extract cleanser too,cleanse skin effectively and less pores after using the product Love this! I have 2 bottles of it and I use this as the first cleanser and than I also use another cleanser. My skin feels great afterwards. I have had no problem getting makeup off with this. I also have not had any pimples with this. Great product. I recommend. This very gently exfoliate’s your skin and cleans out your pores. It’s gentle enough for my sensitive skin and works well on my combination skin Love Love Love!!! If your an oily skin girl like em then you must try it! I love this cleanser. I’ve been using it for the past three months and I am obsessed. Nice cream lather :) it’s definitely helped combat my oil and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. The smell takes some time to get use to (very clay) but it quickly goes away. I use this in combination with the rare earth clay mask and it’s a great combo! I love the texture of this cleanser and the light exfoliation. One of the best cleansers I've ever used, and I try a ton!! Soooo good!! Left my skin feeling hydrated and now dry like most scrubs. And also the scrub was not too harsh I highly recommend this face wash for daily use. I have combination skin and have tried many face washes over the years... This product doesn't leave the skin dry after each use and leaves a clean, reduced pore skin instead. I get really oily during the summer and I get a lot of blackheads. This cleanser really helps mattify my face, as well as go deep enough to clean my pores. It’s also very gentle and refreshing! I’m 32 and I’ve had a problem with large pores my whole life, not anymore and this cleans EVERYTHING off of my face. I'm on my third bottle of this stuff! I tried to try something new and purchased the Dr Dennis Gross Cleanser (the exfoliating one) but I found it did not exfoliate my skin like this one. The exfoliation is so subtle and not scrubbing your skin at all, but it's the perfect amount for my skin's needs. I tend to need frequent exfoliating otherwise i'll get build up under my skin that won't come to the surface for weeks to months, this completely got rid of those for me! I tried the chemical exfoliating route as I heard it's \"gentler\" but this beat it. Highly recomend! (Skin Type is Combo/Normal)\n",
      "…read more It’s an amazing product, I had to use it for awhile until I finally started seeing results and The results are amazing like my skin feels amazing and I rarely have any acne around my jawline. Both are in my lineup of favorite facial cleansers. I have been using DE products for years and these are one of the few items I come back to time and time again. They are gentle yet effective, and the two mini bars last me a couple months. I buy the minis simply because it is hard to pick a favorite between the two. Small but mighty... I LOVE these little bars. They are concentrated with a silky cleanser that leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized, not stripped of oils that other cleansers leave you feeling. There’s no need to handle the bar too much, it gives enough suds to take off my makeup nicely. I did previously purchase the bars with the vinyl zipper holder, but these will be refill for that. The one bar is an exfoliating bar, which is not harsh. Great for travel. I love Drunk Elephant.\n",

I'm buying the large sizes when these run out which will still be a while! I wanted to wait until after I used this duo for about a month before I say if I like or don’t like it. Now that it has been a month I can honest to God say I LOVE THESE! So gentle but my skin feels absolutely clean. I use the JuJu in the morning and Peekee bar at night and I began noticing results almost immediately.

The light bar is for night and is my favorite, it doesnt irritate my sensitive patches. I feel super clean and my face is clear and glowy. Great price, great products.\n",
      "…read more I've been using these DE bars for the last two years. I always buy the minis because they last me quite a while. It's nice to be able to switch between the bars depending on if I want a fresh wash or a deeper exfoliating wash when I need it. Before using this tonight I had dried skin on my face probably due to Sunday Riley's Good Genes. I didn't want to exfoliate too soon so I waited a few days. Makeup really looks like crap with dry skin. But here's a picture right after rinsing Caudalie. Very vulnerable ;) Love it! Great exfoliating without being too harsh. This has been my go to exfoliator for the past 4 years. It is absolutely amazing and the only one that I could find that actually does it’s job!! So very pleased!! To me this product is a lifesaver. You can see results after the very first use.. i would highly recommend this product to people who want to have clear clean skin .. Feels so fresh on your skin and then afterwards your skin is super soft! I use this daily as my skin gets becomes dull quickly. It’s awesome for getting rid of dead skin and cleaning all the sweat and make up. I am obsessed with this cleanser. After I use it, my skin feels minty fresh and is super soft and smooth. The package is smaller than I anticipated, but the product makes up for it. I will definitely be repurchasing! I love the way my skin feels after using this product. There is a cooling effect at the end that is very refreshing. My pores look smaller after using it. Typical Caudalie, smells amazing and does a great job! It has very fine granules to gently slough off dead skin cells. It has a 'slight' tingling sensation but nothing major. Another beautiful product from Caudalie! I have eczema and the most dry/sensitive skin, and this does not irritate it at all! Yet it still deep cleans and REALLY exfoliates. I will probably use this forever. 10/10 recommend. Love this exfoliator! Left my skin feeling silky smooth. It was not harsh on my skin like exfoliators I have used in the past. I use it once a week since I do have sensitive skin. YES FOR SENSITIVE & BREAKOUT PRONE SKIN!! I wear concealer, contour, blush, highlight, and setting powder and ONE wipe takes off all my makeup. Gentle on your skin and the packaging is durable which is a plus for traveling. I have the wipes in my work bag & the cleansing spa water bottle at home. It’s amazing! This has to be the best cloths I ever used on my face. It takes off my makeup so well. Believe the hype! The price is just too expensive for the amount of product you get. Even though I love them, I probably won’t be repurchasing because of the price. I hate how much I love these wipes. KathleenLights talks about them in her empties and Sephora sale haul videos all the time... the price is ridiculous don’t get me wrong... I have pretty oily skin and struggle with redness. Most wipes leave my face feeling awful because they’re too abrasive but these wipes are my holy grail. They take my makeup off no matter how much I have on. It removes eyeliner, mascara, any lipstick, etc. I can use one wipe and get my face completely clean. There’s no sticky residue, it doesn’t leave my face feeling stripped, and the best part is it never ever stings my eyes whenever I’m removing eye makeup. That’s what really sold these wipes for me because almost every wipe I’ve tried has made my eyes water. I truly can’t say enough great things about these wipes honestly.\n",

I have tried many face wipes, including drug store and high end that have irritated the heck out of my skin but nothing compares to these. I was lucky enough to to receive my first pack in a beauty subscription box and fell in love. Yes they are or yes but so worth it. The thickness of the towelette and the ingredients are spectacular. These are holy grail.\n",

They clean the face so well, don't rub or tug, no harsh smells, and leave my skin feeling balanced, clean, and fresh. So many face wipes leave me with a residue, none here! Other wipes also either dry me out too much, or don't do enough to remove my excess oil (I naturally have oily/combo skin); these are perfect. I feel clean but not stripped, tight, or dry. Finished my free pack, and bought 3 more!\n",
      "…read more I purchased these specifically for travel as I don't like to use make up remover wipes. They are terrific! Thick, not drying to the skin and do a great job of removing the make-up. I already reordered as a travel frequently for business and this has become part of my travel essentials. Convenient pack perfect for traveling. I love using these cloths over makeup wipes Because these don’t have that smell that makeup wipes do and they don’t leave my face feeling gross. These are thick cloths, I just wish they were a bit softer and had a slight texture These cloths are amazing. Yes, they are definitely pricey, but they truly are worth every penny. The cloths are thicker than regular make up wipes, and has a very spa like fresh scent. They are very gentle on the skin, but powerful in cleaning every bit of makeup off. These are the first make up wipes that don’t leave my skin feeling dry and tight. On the contrary, my skin feels nicely cleansed, and almost moisturized. This has definitely been a game changer for me in terms of make up wipes, and I love them!\n",

Love the texture of this. Left my skin feeling SO clean and soft. I’ve been looking for a good daily exfoliator and this is it. Smells great. Love the fine grit feeling. Cleans skin perfectly. Perfect for getting rid of makeup or oiliness. My go to cleanser that i use every day! exfoliates just the right amount. Very recommend I have been using this for over 2 years now. I used to use it only 2-3 times a week but have started it using 5 times or more as I have aged and find especially in the fall/winter my skin gets flakey. I use it in the morning in the shower before I get ready for work and it leaves my skin super smooth before applying makeup! I have recently found it isn't working as well so I think I may need to switch to something even deeper toe exfoliate maybe once per week. But honestly, I would recommend this to anyone. A bottle lasts 3-4 months as well!\n",

It is great for cleansing 2-3 times a week. I feel that it leaves my skin truly clean. Perfect way to start my day. I like that it exfoliates but is not harsh and I can use it daily. I feel like this really cleans my face well and leaves it squeaky clean. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cleanser. It's gentle, unscented, the exfoliating beads are the perfect texture and density, and I find it really leaves my skin feeling clean without any unnecessary perfumes or residues. I received a sample of this product about 4-5 years ago, and I have been using it ever since! I love this cleanser, it feels amazing. My skin has thee best glow! When researching, I was looking for a face wash that I could use every day to exfoliate but also clean out my pores and make them look smaller. This is just that. I don't think I will ever need another face wash after using this product. It has very little scent too which I really like, isn't too harsh of an exfoliant but definitely gets rid of all the dead skin on my face without over drying. Such a great exfoliating cleanser! I'm pretty sure I'm currently on my 4th bottle, lol. I'm now on my 4th tube of this and I absolutely love it! The granules in it are perfect so they aren't too gentle that you don't feel that it's doing anything but not so harsh that it hurts to use it. My skin feels so soft and looks great after using it and I highly recommend it. I love this product. I’ve always been weary of exfoliating because of how harsh it is on my skin. Finally, I’ve found a product that not only exfoliates, but gives a fantastic glow as well. I truly see a difference in my skin. I also love how u can use it daily without it being too harsh. I enjoy Clinique products. This works great for my oily skin. Not harsh at all. I have used this since the 1970's. It isn't for people with skin that is dry at all. My skin is an oil pit and this is amazing for it. It contains salicylic acid as an exfoliant. Many years ago I noticed that not only did it lift dirt and oil from my skin and keep it clear, when I had a cold and got those rough red flakes around my nose, it instantly lifted those and didn't even sting. If you don't have super oily skin, use a lower level of clarifying lotion. They are quite specific. Maybe one day I'll have to move down one or even two levels but at age 65 this still works for me.\n",

My skin looks smoother, pores are smaller, and improved acne as well I’ve been using this product for about 2 years now for my combination skin. It’s not too drying and really cleanses the skin without stripping the necessary oils. Makes my skin look so clean and refreshed and keeps me from getting oily. I have been using this product for two years now and I can say it is definitely good. You also get a lot for your money. I've been using this toner for probably 6 years! It makes my skin feel fresh and clean without stripping it of moisture. (I have combination skin for context.) I love this product. No matter what cleanser I love this toner. It is the best at removing all my makeup. Plus it’s not super drying, but still feels super clean This works really well and is the most essential part of my skin care routine! I have very oily acne prone skin and this helps wipe the dirt off and clears my skin. It really works!! This has become one of my favourite toners. I have combination skin leaning more towards oily. I use this after removing my makeup, cleansing and washing my face. The toner removes whatever is left and leaves my skin feeling incredibly clean. I also use this on my chest, back and neck and I’m amazed at what comes off. This may be too strong for those with very sensitive skin so do your research. Literally the best there is. I tried Glossier's version as well as the coveted Pixie version. They both royally screwed with my skin. I have super sensitive skin but this works wonders! It's amazing and I love it and will never live without it! :) Seems simple but works wonderfully to take off all makeup but especially good on eye makeup.

This is a fantastic product! It still cannot by itself completely remove the waterproof eyeliner etc, but I use this after using coconut oil I love product and I can’t believe I’m excited about a makeup remover. Somehow this stuff removes all my eye makeup without any greasiness. I wear contacts so most effective removers can leave an oil film on my lenses which is near impossible to remove.

Great product! Love this product line. I also have the clay cleanser and alternate between the two. If you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend you give this product line a try. Wow. Hands down my holy grail discovery of 2019. The product is incredibly comforting and soothing- from the instant it is used. By itself, it works extremely well to soothe redness and irritation. This is absolutely bolstered using other products in the line. I would describe the product as being milky, smooth, and lightly hydrating. It is very easy to spread around the face, erasing any chance of pulling or accidental physical exfoliation with your hands. I double cleanse and do not use this to remove makeup, so I can't speak to that element of the cleanser. As someone with extremely sensitive skin and many of the issues that go along with this, I have seen massive improvements in redness and inflammation since using this product. It also works really well if I have a pimple or small breakout, since it is so calming it drastically decreases the size and appearance of blemishes by reducing inflammation. Another thing I love about this product is its packaging- a lot of product comes in here, and one full pump is exactly enough for perfect full coverage of the face. I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive, slightly dry skin.\n",

Personally, it’s a solid choice and I enjoy using it in rotation but it’s not my favorite cleanser. I’m giving it 5 starts for my parents (early 60s) who tried a sample I had and love it. My biggest complaint is that I feel like it leaves a sort of film over my face when I get out of the shower, but that’s the reason my mom loves it. She says it’s perfect for cleansing without drying out her skin. What I love most about it is the super calming fragrance that I enjoy in all of REN’s products.

It went from normal to combination to oily to dry and sun damaged to poof add some hormonal acne. My skin was an absolute nightmare... until now!

It is so soft and smooth and leaves my skin clean and happy. It doesn’t seem to be a deep clean but it is perfect for normal days and it does not irritate my skin at all. Love this product. I have dry acne prone skin, this cleanser works really well for me. My skin feels super hydrated after washing, no tightness or irritation at all! My face still feels clean afterwards despite it being so gentle and it seems to help with the minor redness I naturally have in the center of my face too. This is a great cleanser with clean ingredients, what’s not to love? I don’t wear much makeup but this seems to remove what I do wear. Great texture, very gentle, great size for the price. This has absolutely improved my complexion. I use it daily in the AM. True, it does not take off waterproof mascara but I don't expect it to. Wonderful for my red / rosacea-y prone face. Been using it daily for about 6 months. An awesome neutral facial cleanser. Removes makeup very easily and your face is so clean and soft afterwards. I am slowly replacing my skincare regimen with all Ren... one of the best brands that Sephora carries! These wipes are awesome. It takes everything off with out you having to rub and rub. I Love It! With the \"Take the Day of\" Balm it´s a perfect combination for cleansing. My favorite makeup remover wipes. I've tried them all from the drugstore Neutrogena to the fancier Ole ones and these are still my go-to. I actually prefer the smaller size of these wipes because it means you get more (50 wipes instead of the standard 25) and it's nice for days you don't have a ton of makeup. On really heavy days I use two but I can still make it work with just one if I use the right angles. I feel like this gets every little bit off. Love it. Thoroughly exfoliating. Doesn’t irritate my skin. Seems to make a noticeable difference in texture, radiance, and clarity of my skin when used biweekly. The granules are coarse and scrub very well. Love it! I can see where my skin is clearing up. I follow a specific cleanser process but this is the main product I use. I had shingles on my face 6 months ago, and I had a horrible time with acne (and never have this problem otherwise) only in the area of the shingles for months afterwards. Even a facial didn’t cure it. I decided to try this product out of desperation and I am sold!!

At first I did not like this and wanted to send it back but that is because I did not read the directions properly (dumb me). This product is best if you lightly pressed in circles all over your face for 1-2 min. It takes time, unlike harsher scrubs, but it is very very effective when used properly. I even used it daily for less time on my chin which gets congested. Tube is still going strong for me after a lot of use over several month.

It really gets all your makeup off easily and doesn't dry your skin out. The price is great as it lasts a realllllly long time. You only need a pea amount or smaller. Great cleanser for taking your makeup off. I have been using this for years and it’s good for all skin types, even sensitive skin. I have yet to find a facewash that I love as much as this one!! I always take my makeup off with the cleansing balm Love the product! It’s is so smooth on the skin and washes off with a few rinses. Laters well and I only need to use very little quantity for each wash. Absolutely a fan! ❤️ I have been using this product for years and I swear by it for makeup removal. Leaves skin soft! I have very sensitive skin & no problems with this product. The container also lasts nearly a year. BEST cleanser ever! I received this as a CHRISTmas gift and just started using it... I absolutely love love LOVE it! I only use a small pea size amount and it cleans away all the make up Excellent cleanser that left my oily skin feeling clean. I switched from the new formula of Ceramic Slip and no more breakouts or makeup residue when using Clinique. This is my new standard cleanser. A little goes a long way. Love it. Primarily using this after using the Sephora cleansing oil balm.. a little bit goes a long ways and it does it’s job by removing all residue.. great product. I've been using this product for years. I remove my eye makeup with a liquid remover, then lather this into my skin to remove the rest of my makeup, followed by a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer. This really is the best product for getting rid of foundation and other face makeup. Can't be beat! Holy Grail for a sturdy pre-cleanse, this high lathering cleanser will literally get everything off your skin and then some. It’s recommend as a first step cleanser, don’t forget to moisturize after. Amazing for when I need to remove makeup, sunscreen, etc. Comprable product is Origins’ Checks I love this, it’s my second bottle and defiantly will keep on my shelf. Good second step cleanser This cleanser is gentle on my skin & I absolutely love the citrus scent! I love Murad! They are the best skin care line that I have been able to find. This cleanser leaves my face and chest feeling clean and refreshed. It has even helped me get rid of some unwanted acne. Amazing. This product cleared up my acne so fast and leaves my skin feeling really nice. For me it isn’t drying or harsh even tho it has citrus stuff in it. Absolutely love! Love this cleanser. I first tried in it the bright vibes pack. Loved it so much I had to get the full size. This provides a gentle clean with a fresh burst of vitamin c. Actually leaves face feeling clean without over drying. Has helped even dark spots over time I can not go a day without this! I first got a sample and never looked back it’s worth the money, you only need a small amount when washing your face. My skin has never been so consistently clear. Smells citrusy and feels kind of jelly at first. It’s super gentle and has even taken off my makeup. Love this stuff! I don’t know what happened but I tried this cleanser and my face cleared up like magic. No more clogged pores or dark spots. Very impressed and was not expecting such results! I got this as a sample in one of my subscription boxes. Most cleansers break me out, and I am really reluctant to try anything that isn't my normal stuff. I am so glad I tried this. I have sensitive skin that does not respond well to most products, but almost immediately I noticed a difference using this. However, lots of products seem to make a difference on me, then in a couple of weeks, my skin revolts. So I waited, and used this now for 2 months. I use it in the morning, and when I get home from work. The difference in my skin texture and health since starting using this is madness. I still have hormonal outbreaks in my chin area, but the intensity this past cycle was night and day. It cleared up far quicker than usual, with far less intensity. This is an extremely gentle, reliable cleanser. I plan on buying this well into the future.\n",
      "…read more I use this as my daily morning cleanser, and it makes my skin feel so clean and look fresh! It has nice orange smell, washes off easily, and brightens the skin. I have horrible skin, I am 30 yrs old with acne and eczema. My face is very sensitive and gets red when something the least bit irritating touches it. I originally used Murad anti aging acne wash but the acid was too harsh for my skin. This however, has been a god send. My face doesn't dry out yet it keeps the acne away. Love all of the Murad products for acne, has been my only skin care regimen for 5 years. Just wish it wasn’t so pricey for such a small amount of product. Perfect for oily face it is clear and hydrate the face I brought a lot of toner but this toner it the best for my face I started getting facials regularly and she used a lot of murad products. Once I got them for myself and started using this toner twice a day, my skin is sooo clear, soft and even. I love how this makes my skin feel. Absolutely love Murad products, I use just about all the acne line. I felt I needed something for my pores and this product has really helped with cleaning out my pores even minimizing the appearance. I use this nightly after face cleanser, sometimes if I feel my face is grimy I’ll use it before my morning moisturizer then makeup. Great toner for acne, blackhead, oily, prone skin. Helps keep my oil under control and get rid of any left over dirt on my face. Has a nice, refreshing cooling sensation a few seconds after applying it. 10/10 This toner is amazing ! It has a cooling effect on the skin that lasts a brief moment but it’s so satisfying ! I have replaced my other toner with this. I have been using this toner, along with the skin perfecting lotion, for over two weeks now. I have oily, acne prone skin and since starting this my skin has cleared up so much. My skin tone is much more even, and it really helps to reduce oil production throughout the day (which was not a concern I needed addressed, but a bonus indeed). It definitely has a cooling sensation upon application, which I find to be quite calming.\n",

Like omg how did I possibly find a toner that makes my skin so nice This product is great! An esthetician recommended because I was using a scrub that she said was too tough on my skin, and I was complaining about bumps on my forehead from summer heat/sweat.

I’ve found this to be gentle enough to use everyday without causing irritation, and effective enough that I can really tell it’s helping to clear my congested skin. I love this stuff. I got it as a sample the first time and used it to the last drop. And immediately bought more. Just a small amount goes a long way and it really clears out the pores. My skin doesn't feel stripped or tight after I use this, which is the key thing I look for in a cleanser, since I'm prone to dryness. I've been using this for several years, and when I compare it against products I've received samples of, I like this better. I've purchased this twice now, both times for my husband but I end up using it. Effective to take off makeup and the mask feature is really amazing. I notice a difference every time. This was a repurchase for me (third time) as I've been using it for years. Even though I use it almost everyday, this tube lasts me 4 months or more. A little goes a long way, and I find it fantastic in managing oil and clearing my skin - so much so I bought another for my sibling and his face cleared up in a week. Overall, excellent. I've never used it as a mask, but I'm assuming it works just as well. Amazing face wash - my pores have never been so small Leaves skin smooth and nicely exfoliated. My husband got this in a Jack Black kit a few years ago but didn't use it, so I did and was extremely impressed!!! Not to mention it's less expensive than the facial products that are marketed towards women!!! Love it! I used to get a lot of breakouts from clogged pores before switching to this cleanser, it's phenomenal. For as potent as it is, it really isn't very drying, either. My husband used this when he was having breakouts and reactions to his usual cleaner. This product cleared up any blemishes quickly. Love this face wash/mask. Doesn't over dry my skin. I usually have oily skin, but in winter it will get dried out periodically. Love this! Its helped with the tiny hard bumps that nothing else touches. Leaves your face so clean. It can be drying so don't over do it if you have dry or sensitive skin. if you suffer with little stubborn bumps that don’t go away when you’ve tried everything, YOU NEED THIS. i suffered with these little bumps forever and tried so many products but nothing ever worked. I pray this on my face before moisturizer and this magic took it all away. This is legit magic in a bottle. Helps acne and smooth sensitive skin too! Best balancing toner for dry/oily skin! Use before bed and before moisturizer in the AM! I love how it smells like real jasmine! As soon as I spray my face I feel so fresh and ready to go! I have very oily skin so this helps cut back and paired with the fenty primer I think its really working! Would definitely buy again! So after using 2 bottles of this already! I finally can say, this is the best toner I have ever used. This toner has a very gentle smell to it, for me I enjoy it, kinda smells like rice grains. I use this in the morning right after washing my face. I have dry to normal skin. So I tend to spray this on when my skin is still wet. I don’t use a cotton pad, I spray it directly on and pat it in after. After 2 bottles, I notice my skin is not as red, dry and flaky! This has so many amazing ingredients that will do wonders to the skin. I would recommend to those who have acne, hormonal acne, or a toner to use in general.\n",
      "…read more I had read great reviews about this toner and was so excited to get in the mail. Honestly, my first impression was kinda disappointing, but only because of the smell. BUT it’s not a bad smell. It smells just like green tea. I don’t know what I was expecting because duh ofcourse it’s going to smell like green tea. So I kept using it for about a week just to see if it did anything. And I’m glad I did because I started to notice that my skin felt so balanced, clean & comfortable right before applying my serum & moisturizer. I only need to spray 3 to 4 times and never have to wipe any excess in with a cotton pad. The spray component looks like a regular pump spray action but is surprisingly very fine and soft like a micro mist. The glass bottle is so pretty I like to leave it out on the counter. Overall, I’m so impressed with this product. I have combo skin, but would recommend this for all skin types too.\n",
      "…read more I really loved the smell and the feel when I use it. I am prone to cystic acne with redness and this product helped myself with controlling it. I used this along with Herbivores Glow Potion and I noticed my skin started to clear up after about a week of use. Would highly recommend this product for those with redness, acne or a combo of both. Instantly moisturizes and calms skin for oiliness, breakouts and dryness. AMAZING smell and safe to use daily. This must be a love it or hate it scent based on the comments but I LOVE the scent! I haven’t been using this for long but I am less oily for SURE and the blemishes I had before I started this are clearing up nicely. Love love love. LOVE LOVE LOVE - this cleansing oil is amazing. I’ve been using it for over a year and it works wonders for my skin. I have an oily T-zone and on most days I use this as my only cleanser but I double cleanse with it as well. It doesn’t have a strong scent, lasts a long time, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I’ve tried other cleansing oils (like Biossance) and found they break me out and left my skin feeling dry. It has also never stung my eyes but I don’t use it as my primary eye makeup remover. If I’m wearing waterproof makeup it will not remove it all but it will lossen it up and make it much easier to take off with a makeup remover.\n",
      "…read more Hands down the best cleansing oil I've used. I would say it's as good as the Tatcha Cleansing Oil but a little more budget-friendly. It's very light and washes off easily without leaving a film or residue on my face. I sometimes use this alone when going from bare face days to makeup nights. The smell is also quite nice, very light. I added this to my nighttime skin routine and I don’t think I’ll be getting rid of it. Once again, kiehls has a winner. This stuff smells so good. I am actually not a big fan of lavender but the scent is not overly potent. It smells very fresh and dewy. I use it all over my face and massage it for a minute or so before I get in the shower at night. This gets rid of all my eye makeup without irritating my eyes. This is hands down the best cleansing oil I’ve used. I double cleanse so I use this first on my face dry to really break down makeup etc and then rinse and f/u with a cleanser. It’s smells great thanks to the lavender oil and also contains squaline which leaves my skin feeling soft without tightness. Highly recommend! This a holy grail, I’ve used plenty of cleansing oil and nothing compares to this! I’m a full face type of girl too, and nothing stands up to this! It even removes highly pigmented eyeshadows that usually leave stains, with ease. I pair it with my makeup remover cloth and this seriously saves me so much time at night. Getting low and will definitely repurchase time and time again. I LOVE this oil! it stared to double cleanse my face and it is amazing, i used to remove my makeup and it literally melts the makeup and the eye lashes glue so you don't have to pull the lashes and take your natural lashes off! So I've discovered I'm allergic to coconut oil and surprise, SOO many oil cleansers have some trace of it in their products. This is the only cleanser that will breakdown EVERYTHING before I go in with a second cleanser. It never clogs my pores or leaves a residue. In the winter on no makeup days, I'll cleanse with this just because it leaves the slightest amount of moisturization on my skin. Highly recommend for sensitive skin folks (my eczema and cystic acne skin behind me).\n",
      "…read more I've been exploring other cleansing oils but I always come back to this one. My skin LOVES it and it gets my daily makeup off. It's that perfect texture that doesn't make you drag your fingers to work it in, it just glides and breaks everything up. I absolutely love it and after my last purchase I think I'm going to stop jumping around and marry this thing. I LOVE this stuff! It makes my skin feel SO smooth and hydrated even though i just washed it. I love the smell and silkiness of it. I do normally take off my eye make up first, but this helps to get every last bit of it washed off. Totally recommend. Love this product and the scent is my absolute favorite. I use this mostly at night after I've used a makeup wipe to get most of my makeup off. My skin feels super soft and clean after I use it, no greasy residue. I have had the bottle for 6 months and it's not even close to being empty. Love this product, completely takes off all makeup and melts it instantly. When followed by a gel or foam face wash skin is perfectly clean and refreshed without feeling overly dry. Worked great with my oily skin! Fantastic for dry, sensitive skin. My skin usually revolts whenever I try something new, however the first time I used this my skin felt soft, moisturized, and didn’t have any breakouts or react in anyway. My skin has rosacea, and is very particular and sensitive to products but really responded so well to this. I initially got the product in a beauty box as a sample size, but purchased the full size nearly a week after. I started looking at this product after falling in love with a sample of the Midnight Recovery Treatment Oil some time back. I finally got a deluxe sample bottle of this to try and I'm in love all over again! This was everything I was hoping and expecting it to be. This stuff takes off my makeup in no time, especially any pesky mascara that is lingering. It leaves my dry skin feeling clean and hydrated all at the same time. Best of all? It has that same amazing, soothing herbal scent that all of Kiehl's Midnight Recovery products have. I only cleanse at night, so this scent is perfect for a relaxing nighttime routine. I have discovered my holy grail and will not think twice about buying the full size- especially because it takes so little product to do the job, the full size should last me a very long time. I love you, Kiehl's...please take my money.\n",
      "…read more This scrub works so well for shaving irritation. Bought it for my bf and after just one use his irritation was significantly better. He uses this just before he shaves and it works like a charm. Highly recommend! Best scrub out there. I only use this twice a week but it works so well. Love the scent! I initally bought this for my boyfriend as over the past year I have gotten him hooked on all things Jack Black and this is the most recent purchase - but I LOVE IT TO! So invigorating and also makes my skin SO SMOOTH. I just bought another one since we are both using it. I highly recommend for anyone! Energizing is true. This is that type of cleanser that gets really cold/cool on your face. It definitely wakes you up, and does the exfoliating I need! PS: I am a female who purchased this and loves using it. I was a bit worried it would be too harsh on my skin, but it sure wasn't. I rarely write reviews but felt compelled with this product. I bought my husband a Jack Black kit this past Christmas, and while he's obsessed with the regular face wash Love this scrub! It is refreshing and cooling! After washing my face I use this scrub and keep it on for a few minutes and then wash it off. Skin does not feel stripped and feels so soft and awaken! I have been using this face wash or 11 years now. It has kept my skin clear glowing! Obsessed!!! I read up on this brand and after trying out so many different Jack Black tofu ya I am a firm believer! I am a female and use the buff before my face wash to make sure all makeup was removed. ( plus it wakes you up if you use it in AM) It’s become a genderless brand. Two words...beard lube...closest shave of you life for men and women. My legs aren’t only hair free, but moisturized from this product as well. All their products I have bought are 5 stars in my book!\n",
      "…read more I know it’s a skincare line made for men, but I absolutely love the way it works and the smell. I feel like I’m at the spa. I use it about once or twice a week. My boyfriend LOVES IT. I bought it for him, he has a beard and usually he gets ingrown hair, or pimples. He started using this scrub and it controlled perfectly his sebum production. It has mint and he loves the tangling sensation on his skin. My husband loves this. Was looking for something gritty. Used to buy Clinique Mens Scrub before they changed the formula. Likes this even more! Also, commented that he liked the scent even though this is normally something he would complain about. Asked me to buy in bulk! Bought this one for my boyfriend and he loves it! It smells amazing too (minty and citrus-y) This is an amazing and fine grained face scrub. It's now the only one I use. I also wanted to point out that Sephora's posted ingredient list is old. This no longer contains polyethylene beads (plastic beads). It now uses bamboo powder. So no fish oceans or aquatic life are damaged when the product goes down the drain. Takes my makeup off with one wipe it’s amazing. Also they don’t burn my eyes like many of the other makeup wipes do. Totally recommend Love these facial cloths! Great for sensitive skin! Removes most of my make up before I wash my face. I have been so pleased with all of philosophy’s products. I love these wipes! They smell amazing (but not in a perfume, artificial way), they clean very well, and my skin feels so fresh after use! In the summer, I use them all over my body if I’ve been out in the heat, and my skin goes from gross and sweaty to smelling delightful and feeling refreshed! Wonderful and refreshing! I have sensitive skin, even everyone’s hg Neutrogena wipes break me out, but these work like a dream and smell fabulous. I go between these and Shiseido’s facial clothes and always have one set in my bag. We keep them in every bathroom for guests who just need a freshen up also and get many compliments. I’ve bought every brand of wipes known to man. From high end to cheap brands and this by far took off the make up on lazy days, caked on foundation with a setting powder. Worth the $ Best wipes on the market. Gentle and inoffensive almost fragrantless in sturdy packaging so they don’t dry out. One sheet usually enough to take off a face fill of makeup. Removes my make up very well without irritation or breakouts. Safe to use around the eyes, did not burn! This cleanser was recommended to me by a Sephora employee and it has changed my life. I have struggled with consistent breakouts and nothing has ever seemed to work until I tried this. It's my holy grail. This product works miracles!!! Had horrible acne on cheeks and tried everything. This also with the rosewater and witch hazel. You can’t go wrong This was great, my face enjoys this cleanser. I’ve had a lot less breakouts and my face is soft and the texture is improving. We’ll be making this my main cleanser this is like water for my skin!! i struggled with acne for a couple years and tried everything but this really helped me a lot. My skins not fully clear yet but it’s been almost 20 days since i’ve purchased. The smell isn’t that great but who cares, it does it’s magic. Not that drying and doesn’t leave your skin feeling uncomfortably tight!! This is my favorite facial cleanser ever and well worth the price in my opinion. Plus it lasts a while because you really just need 2 small pumps and it spreads. I have combination skin that leans more towards oily - just gets dry in the winter. I also have a condition that tends to mess with my hormones so I have been breaking out a lot lately. I tried a billion different facial cleansers from all natural to medical to super expensive to pharmacy store aisle, and everything either aggravated my adult acne even more, or did absolutely nothing. This leaves my face feeling firm, crisp, and clean throughout the whole day, and I haven't had a breakout since using it!\n",

I struggled with hormonal acne for years and now am left with hyperpigmentation. I’ve been using this cleanser for about a month and my face is starting to look amazing. This cleanser does such an amazing job as cleansing the skin as well and it smells soooo good (similar time Lychee). Seriously, if you struggle with acne or hyperpigmentation get this!

I am your typical case of an all-of-a-sudden breakout kinda gal. My hormones were really messing with my skin and i have literally tried EVERYTHING. Just imagine any option, and i tried it. Whatever my bank account was wiling and able to spend. I even went to an esthetician and she gave me great products, but i just couldn't keep paying those costs. So i did a bunch of research and just tried my luck, my face couldn't get any worse. After a few weeks of the boscia clear complexion cleanser, paired with Rose Water Mist with Witch Hazel and the Chia Seed Moisturizer, my face is finally getting back on track. It didn't at first because i was using a serum from another company, paired with a spot treatment from another company cause i just thought that's what you're supposed to do... but this simple three step process has really worked for me, Hope this inspires anyone who was just as frustrated as i was to just keep trying and to find what your skin loves.

This cleanser, compared to the Cleansing Gel, leaves more of that \"sqeaky\" clean feeling. I’ve been struggling with acne the most in my life with a timeline of me being 21-27 and this cleanser has given me the best results with my skin routine. It’s gentle and it cleanses my skin where i feel comfortable going out with no makeup! Highly recommend! Been using it for 2 days but I’m already in love with it. The gel itself is red and almost sparkly, it’s super fun. Smells good but no super strong overbearing fragrances like a lot of other cleansers. Immediately after I feel clean and my skin looks better. Helps with acne without being too abrasive, perfect gentle night time cleanser which was just what I wanted. Follow with a good moisturizer it can dry you out a bit. I’d definitely recommend it!\n",
      "…read more I have oily Skin and i have a very hard time trying to find a face wash that will make my skin feel clean and either not too dried out or not too oily. This is the one! You only need a dime size amount. I use my Foreo to exfoliate once i have it on, I leave it for about 20-30 seconds and then rinse. If you have a chance to try this out i would HIGHLY recommend to my oily skin friends! I just started using this about a month ago (along with FAB Acne Clearing pads) and my skin has cleared completely. I used to break out before my periods- not any more! I have super dry skin and this doesn’t dry my face out. I love this product and have been using it for 6 months. This cleanser doesn't irritate or dry out my sensitive/acne prone skin, and it takes off makeup better than any cleanser I've used before. I don't even need micellar water to take off my mascara with this, so I'm hooked. Love this face cleanser. Not too harsh and doesn’t leave my face dry, but definitely cleans skin well and I saw improvement in my skin within a week. I love the other face cleanser by this company and will be adding this one to my skincare routine now My skin felt smoother from the first use and after using it for a month now - morning and night - I can say that my breakouts have essentially stopped all together. Hopefully this keeps up, I'm very very very happy with this so far! I usually follow with the FAB redness relief serum and then ultra repair cream. My favourite skin care combo to date! I just ordered the wild oat toner too so I'm excited to add that into the mix.\n",

The only thing that has cleared by acne again. This cleanser calmed my face and when I added the wipes, made it completely clear again!!! I have been searching for something similar to the Clarisonic deep pore cleanser since they stopped making that and ladies and gentlemen, this is it! My skin has NEVER been good. Huge, dark pores all over my face, combo skin to both extremes, crazy uneven tone, unprovoked breakouts. But this product is a lifesaver!!! Within 2 days, my pores are teeny, my face is one tone, my zits are disappearing and I straight up look like I’m glowing. I am over the moon!!! I really love this product so far. I’ve been using it for about a month and I’ve certainly noticed a difference in my texture, reduced pore size, and blackheads. It’s great because it doesn’t feel too intense, but I can tell it’s working without stripping or over drying my skin. I also like the pump applicator, as it doesn’t waste any product. I’ve been searching for the right toner for a while now, and now my search is OVER!!!\n",

Use this along with the dash wash and moisturizer. It took about a week for my skin to get used to it. It initially burned and my skin became dry but with consistent use my face is so moisturized. It’s reduced my eye bags, my smile lines and has controlled my breakouts all while helping my existing acne heal. I ocasdionalky substitute the moisturizer for Ambi fade cream to tackle the stubborn dark spots and as a result have had to use less make up. My is looking way better!\n",

I use it daily after I shower. This is AMAZING!!! I first had this product used on me during a perk facial and fell in love. It completely changed the look and feel of my face and décolletage. I don’t use it everyday like it suggests, I only use it between 2-3 days a week. Every time I do it looks as though I just had a professional facial done. Good job PTR!! Removes all dirt and excess oil after cleansing. I don’t ever go without this! It’s great for even skin tone, diminishing fine lines and controlling acne. This toner works well-I’ve switched different cleansers and my pores look smaller and my skin looks smoother. I deal with redness and have paired this with Milk’s cooling water along with First Aid serum and moisturizer and it’s been doing wonders for me! My skin is glowing This stuff is liquid gold! I’ve noticed my patchiness with my seasonal skin change disappear and my moisturizer melts into my skin and my makeup lays beautifully. Love love love this toner! I love this cleanser. I don't use it every day because it would be too drying for my dry skin. It definitely chemically exfoliates, the next day I see a huge difference. When mixed with water it runs down my arms while washing my face. My solution is to rub it into my face dry like a mask, then work water in and rinse. This cleared up my acne that i had in the same spot for MONTHS. I have scaring because the acne there was so stubborn but when I use this at night, i notice the next morning it is lighter. Nothing from the dermatologist worked on my skin at all! My skin is really sensitive and drys quickly when using certain products however also becomes really oily. This does dry my skin out but with a good facial lotion it is no problem. In the winter I will use once a week, in the summer I use it about 3 times a week.\n",
      "…read more Worth every penny!! I first used this when I slept over my friend’s dorm and I remember seeing an improvement in my acne the next morning. However, it wasn’t until last week when I actually remembered about it and decided to buy my own. For the past year or so I have had nonstop acne on my cheeks which I’ve been unable to control. The top photos are from May 30th and the bottoms ones are today (June 8th) and ALL my acne is gone from using this product! The only thing I have left is some scaring Which will hopefully fade before too long. For the first time in years I left the house without feeling like I had to cover my face with a hat if I wasn’t wearing makeup! I will say after a week of using this product every day my skin has started to feel very dry around my nose and mouth so going forward I plan on only using this every 3 or 4 days now that it’s done the work getting rid of all my breakouts. Will definitely be buying more from this line!!\n",
      "…read more Great cleanser. Exfoliating and cleansing in one. Cleared all of my clogged pores! I did go through a purging stage and about 2 weeks later it was cleared! I only use at night and follow up with the glycolic acid toner, in the morning I use a less harsh cleanser, just to wash off face products from night before. Best face wash i have used in a really long time. I have acne and this is the only product that never brought on new pimples. it washed all my makeup off and makes my skin fresh and perfect. PERFECT!!! i will be buying again and nothing else ever again to wash my face. seriously....my acne is finally gone Since I started using this, my skin is amazing. My skin tone has evened out, dark spots are fading rapidly, fine lines are vanishing like magic and my glow is back! I’m 53 and my skin looks better than it did when I was 40. I noticed that my serums and moisturizers are absorbing better and my makeup goes on like a dream. Try this - you’ll thank me later! I have combination skin and the WORST texture (no acne problems just patches and bumps) before using this product. I felt like I had tried everything until a Sephora employee recommended this for my dullness/uneven texture and pores. I fell in love! I use this after a gentle cleanser to remove most of my makeup (currently using Youth to the People Kale + Green Tea Spinach Vitamins Superfood Cleanser and LOVE it! But also have used it prior with Drunk Elephant)! I’ve also used it with my hands and clarisonic and both give amazing results! For anyone with bad skin texture/ uneven skin and problems with pores, this is your product! My skin feels so smooth now and my makeup goes on so much better. I use this 1-2x a day but always at night and follow with Belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb. I have never been happier with a skincare product!\n",
      "…read more I've been using this product for about 8 months and I like it. I use it several times per week and it keeps my skin smooth and clean. I like that there is almost no scent and that you only need a small drop to get the job done. The bottle is very big and long lasting. This face wash is my absolute favorite! It cleans very well and removes all makeup. Plus, it really clears your skin and makes it look super youthful. Highly recommend! This has dramatically improved my acne and acne scars. A little goes a long way and you get a huge bottle ! Oh my goddd! I wish I would have found this stuff ten years ago! Holy crap does it work well too! I have literally only been using it for a few days and I can see and feel a huge difference. My skin looks younger and refreshed. I have found it to be rather gentle. I have been using it twice a day for about a week now and so far so good. My pores a visibly smaller and less noticeable. My skin looks more.... taut. I love it.. Botox in a bottle!\n",
      "…read more Hands down, my all time favorite cleanser. My skin feels super clean, without feeling dry. I’ve noticed a difference in my fine lines, and my skin tone appears much more even. I had been using the Murad acne line (which is amazing) because I stopped using his AACG, I don't use products with parabens. The Sephora employee said I didn't want anything with dyes anyway-they're really bad for the skin. I stopped using the murad acne was because I started having breakouts again, after using the product for about 2 years (I guess i got tolerant to it). The employee recommended this and it's been amazing ever since. I still use the other products in the murad line, but switching up the face wash really helped. This does everything it says it will do.\n",
      "…read more This has changed my skin, and my self esteem in an amazing way. I have never gotten compliments on my skin until using this. If you have textured skin or acne prone skin, you need this in your life. I can’t praise this product enough. (Since it is an acid, make sure you use a toner and a sunscreen.). The bottle used to be clear with a clack cap and directed you to wash for 1 minute and rinse with cool water. I’m hopelessly devoted.\n",
      "…read more Great for sensitive skin! I have oily, acneic skin, and EVERYTHING breaks me out. This is gentle and effective at the same time. Highly recommend. LOVE LOVE LOVE boscia blotting sheets! My face gets super oily throughout the day. If you want to remove the shine and dirty feel without removing any of makeup, boscia sheets are the way to go! I like these blotting linens. I used a lot of different ones but these ones are probably the best. Exactly what I expected! Works well even with makeup on. And a friendly price. I love these!! Not only do they get rid of all the excess oil on your face, but they smell really good. These work great and smell yummy...not overpowering. Kept the shine off longer. I wish I could provide more stars. I love these. I’m so upset Sephora has discontinued selling it. Having oily skin and living in the Arizona heat, these have been AMAZING!! I carry this in my backpack and purse and they come in handy anywhere. I’m able to do my whole face on both sides with the oils on my nose, forehead and upper lip area. Also love that you can see the oils being absorbed and you get so many for such a small price. Definitely recommend!!! Absolutely love these! They are a must have if you get shiny mid day. I can’t live without them in my land of summer humidity! They are a bit pricey but I use less of them than other brands because they absorb so well. Love these bigger than average so I only need one! These literally smell amazing, and soak up ALL the oil on my face. I use these with a full face of makeup as well. The trick is to lightly blot the oily areas. Doing so, no makeup will be removed, simply the layer of oil! Love that about these! Oh and the price? What a steal! 100 sheets for only ten dollars. I’ve been buying these for years! My face is an oil slick, but these are so big I only need to use one at a time. I love that these only use natural and minimal ingredients. I’ve even gotten my boyfriend to buy them for himself so he can stop stealing mine. We swear by these! Since you’d be using 2 or 3 sheets from a cheaper brand anyway, these are worth the money 100% !!! Tried many blotting papers but I always come back to these. They are great. Absorb really well and don’t smudge makeup. One sheet is enough for the whole face. Will always recommend. Amazing blotters. The only ones I buy! Does not smudge or remove make up with use. Works great and doesn't take the makeup off My face feel so clean after I use this product and, unlike many products, it doesn’t make my skin break out. It feels terrific. Great cleanser for oily skin in the summer. It doesn’t dry me out, and it feels squeaky clean afterwards. What I love most about it is the smell and how it didn’t break me out. I have super dry skin, especially going into the winter, and this product is super soothing and cleansing! It leaves my skin feeling even and clean and after trying everything from cerave to vichy this is what i’ve been looking for :) Also a bottle lasted me almost 6 months, so great value as well. Good for my sensitive and combinaison skin. Great all year long. I have an acne prone oily skin and this cleanser works great for my skin. I use it every other day since it is a soap based stripping cleanser so can be a little harsh if used daily. But it has cleaned my skin thoroughly and I have very occasional acne issues after I started using this. Perfect balance! Cleanses without stripping my mid 40s skin. Removes all makeup & leaves my skin prepped & ready for serums/treatments/moisturizer. The best cleanser ever!!! Highly recommend! Way better than many (more expensive) cleansers! It gives you the real feeling that your skin is clean! This takes off every inch of my makeup! I have white towels and when I dry off my face after using this my towel remains completely white! It’s not even that expensive and the tube lasts forever. My skin is very sensitive when it comes to face washes and this really is perfect. I really like this cleanser! I wanted something that was gentle, that wouldn't irritate, dry, or leave my my skin feeling greasy. This is it - the scent is SO lovely and my skin feels great! I recommend this for anyone looking for a face wash who has sensitive skin. I love this product! I have struggled with acne from stress from school for a while now and this was just what I needed. It makes my skin feel squeaky clean, but can be a bit drying so use a good moisturizer right after really helps! (But I do have dry skin as it is ) so would be really good for oily skin! Already on my second bottle it’s just so cleansing!! Great cleanser. This one can be my top 3 favorites. Product does what it says. Doesn’t bother eyes when used. I have been using this for 20 years and it’s truly he best for taking off eye makeup. The consistency is similar to water and it’s not greasy, oily and has no odor to it. I have been using this since I was young and my Mom would give me her trial sized ones from Clinique gifts haha! Best eye makeup remover, hands down. Non oily, non irritating around the sensitive eye area. Works like a charm. I don't use water proof mascara so I take as much makeup off with water as I can and then use this to finish up. Have been using a long time and nothing else works as well for me. Removes makeup easily without the greasy feel afterwards! I have sensitive skin and other makeup removers trouble it and cause irritation but this one is not only great for eyes, I use it on my whole face. Soak a cotton pad and hold for a 30 seconds on your eyeliner/mascara then gently brush away. Use another for your face! very gentle and takes off heavy m makeup. you don't have to use a lot. Used this for years. It is the best eye makeup remover. Haved tried others , all brands, prices. They do not compare. Only problem it is ofter out of stock. This is a very gentle hypoallergenic goodness that somehow will take off the toughest makeup. Can be stretched with water on a cotton pad. Great cleanser! My skin clarity has improved since using this product about a month ago. I use this cleanser twice a day and I love the deep clean it provides. Of all the cleansers I’ve used it’s the only one that does a great job of removing my makeup. This is my favorite cleanser. Rebuying is something I rarely do, but I stockpile this stuff. It leaves me feeling so clean, but not dry and itchy. If I don’t use this for a few days, I can tell. My skin starts to feel congested and oily. This keeps my breakouts at bay! This product leaves my skin feeling so soft! My only complaint is that is doesn’t turn into foam...it foams a tiny bit but mainly stays a cream I really don’t write many reviews, but this cleanser deserves one. I tried this out in a Sephora Play back a long time ago (apparently it was very early 2018, according to a different reviewer) and loved it. Somewhere along the way I forgot about it, or maybe I didn’t want to drop $30 on a face wash. I savored the sample for a little too long, but even when using the tiniest bit I saw improvement to my skin. This cleanser feels very silky, and tingles subtly. It isn’t painful at all and feels nice. After I use it, my skin just feels clean. It’s literally softer and feels tighter. People are complaining about the smell, but I don’t really mind it. I think it smells a little minty. I am so happy I got a full size after forgetting it existed. I am a college student with dry skin that’s been a little oily after the weird weather. This has been helping tremendously to clear my skin up.\n",
      "…read more Love this stuff! I have been struggling with breakouts under my chin area which was so odd to me but nothing cleared them up. I took a sample of this with me on vacation and it lasted the whole week and my skin is almost completely clear now. I’m definitely going to purchase the full size. I’m 27 and have dry/ combo skin and it didn’t dry me out worse and it does keep my oilier areas at bay. Really enjoy this product.\n",
      "…read more Love this cleanser! I’ve tried tons and this one works great! Love all the Glam Glo products! Received this in my Play box and it works so well. This is one of my favorite cleansers of all time. I don’t use it every day because it’s very powerful! I wouldn’t recommend this if you have sensitive skin at all! I use this when I have been wearing a ton of makeup all day or sweating a lot. I also use it when I feel like my skin just needs a good, deep clean and don’t have time for a mask. Basically it’s my secret weapon against all the bad crap that can build up in your pores and on your face.\n",
      "…read more I am really enjoying this face wash. It is so silky smooth. I love that it doesn't leave a residue feeling on your face after you rinse. Works well with my dry/oily skin. Face does not feel overly dry after using cleanser this is a great cleanser! my skin felt so soft afterwards and you can tell it's a really deep clean This whole line is like a mini facial morning and night. I love following the scrub with this cleanser.. if I’m in the shower, I’ll lather up and leave it on while I rinse my hair just because it feels so good on my face. It is so soothing and smells heavenly without being overly fragrant. My skin feel soft and glowing, while feeling tighter and my pores appearing smaller. Like most luxury brands, a little really goes a long way! So even though it is expensive, it lasts awhile! I received mine complimentary to test about a month ago and I feel like I barely used a quarter of it, so it is worth a try!\n",
      "…read more This cleanse was very refreshing after the polish! The smell was wonderful and it left my skin feeling clean! I received this product complimentary! I really enjoyed using this product. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth. The scent is wonderful. I would definitely recommend! I have dry skin and this did a great job of cleansing my skin without taking away moisture! I received this product as a free sample. The cleanse is so smooth on my face! It works along side the polish to clean your face and help to make your imperfections go away. After using the Polish, the Cleanse goes on super smooth and allows me to clean off everything that the Polish didn't remove! Once I clean my face with both the Polish and the Cleanse, my face feels super smooth, even before putting on the Nourish moisturizer. These products work best when used daily, and you can use them up to 2 times a day! I definitely suggest this whole system if you are looking for a great skin care routine!\n",
      "…read more I love this cleanse it really helped my dry skin feel less flaky. Love it! This is a lovely, creamy cleanser with a nice citrus scents that deeply cleans my skin without drying or stripping. It has a great pH of about 5.5, so no balancing toner is needed after use. I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes but all my reviews and opinions are my own. In my opinion, this is a fabulous product and I will definitely are a purchase when this tube runs out. Love love love this product. The little micro beads help remove any dry skin on my face without making it so red and rough while using it. Will definitely be purchasing it again. One of my favourite facial scrubs. It’s gentle but gets the job done and doesn’t leave the skin feeling stripped. It’s especially my favourite product to use in the winter as I get many dry patches that need daily exfoliation. I like to try other products for fun but this is an absolute staple in my skincare routine and always will be - it should be yours too! I love this exfoliator, I actually use it a little different than some would but I feel that gives me the best results. I make sure I have cleaned my face then I put the exfoliator on but not while my skin is soaking wet, I like to feel the grains. Then I just wipe it off. I get a better result this way as doing it with a full wet face I don’t feel like it’s exfoliating anything. with the ever present debate on scrubbing everyday, i do, everyday, with this, every morning, and i love it. its not a heavy scrub, gentle enough for every morning use My daughter loves this! It’s a classic staple for anyone! This product has been a staple in my skin care routine since I was 15, I’m 43 now. No other scrub does a better job. I. Love. This. I've been using it since the beginning go the year (yes this small bottle goes a long way). It isn't too harsh on my face and makes it feel clean afterwards. My only advice would be to NOT use this twice a day. I use it at night to really get the rest of my makeup get the makeup wipe missed, followed by toner, a facial mist, and moisturizer. In the mornings, however, I tend to skip any cleansing and go right to toner to avoid scrubbing too many nutrients out of my skin and causing micro-tears.\n",
      "…read more Hands down my favorite scrub. Gentle enough to use on a regular basis but strong enough to make a instant difference. I have used this product for as long as I can remember, and while I have tried several other scrubs, I always come back to this one. CLINIQUE7 Day Scrub Cream Rinse-Off Formula is a great micro scrub to use on a precleansed no make-up face and prior to makeup application to smooth away any dullness or dead skin on the surface. I use this in combination with a benzoyl peroxide cleanser for acne prone skin (please be careful mixing products w/sensitive skin). This clinique scrub is gentle on skin ,upon application it feels like a lotion once worked on skin in circular motion you can feel a small scrubby affect, rinses clean no post grease type residue that some scrubs have. Overall good product and functions as described,also priced at $20,two thumbs up.\n",
      "…read more WHAT??!?? My face felt like porcelain the next morning. I have sensitive skin & this product does not irritate at all!!!! I’ve used it 4 nights in the past 7nights & I’m impressed every time. Im also applying glow recipe sleeping mask and moisturizer in addition to this. I like to use this scrub on my lips. This is my secret for having soft lips in the middle of winter. The granules are smaller than sugar and are more uniform. This is cheaper than the Fresh Sugar Lip Polish and you get 5x more product! made my face super smooth and is very affordable. What more can you ask for!! This is the best, most consistent exfoliator you will use. Perfectly formed beads that you can feel, but not irritate. This is my go to - every other day scrub. I keep it in the shower, which works perfectly to rinse off for smooth glowing skin. I have very sensitive skin (with patches of roseaca) but it does the job without irritation. Love! I've been using this for years and it works great. I use about 2 times a week. Once right before I shave. I think it helps reduce breakouts on my kneck. It doesn't do much to imrprove the texture of my skin, but I always fall back on it as my exfoliator of choice. Love! It exfoliates so well. I use it on dry skin and exfoliate with cotton pads, every other night. I use this every other night and it works great! It removes any extra makeup I have on and my skin feels/looks so soft and hydrated. My favorite cleanser ever. I have very sensitive skin. Cannot use Cetaphil or CeraVe. This cleanser keeps my skin from getting overly dry and feels luxurious when I'm washing my face. I'm obsessed. Love this to remove my make up as a first cleanse. Genuinely makes me look forward to washing my face, which can be hard to do. I have really sensitive skin and use prescription acne products that dry out my skin like crazy, and this is the best cleanser I have found! Definitely worth the splurge. My dry skin prefers this cleansing milk over the more popular Fresh cleanser. It's so lovely and gentle - just right for a light morning cleanse. Wish there were a travel size of this one! Really good , cleanses skin without making a mess & no water needed . I use mine with a cotton to wipe my face and it removes all the dirt I really like this. I double cleanse at night but wanted to start using an actual cleanser in the morning to remove traces of my nighttime actives and sweat. This cleanser is gentle and makes my skin feel so soft. I would say this one is better for normal-dry skin as it definitely adds hydration. You rub this onto dry skin (per the instructions) and it feels like a light moisturizer. It rinses off very quickly and gently. My skin gets a little glow and never feels tight afterwards. Love this cleanser! Great morning cleanse. My skin feels soft and not tight at all but clean. This deserves way more hype! I bought this a few months ago but finally got a chance to open it. My all time favorite cleanser is the normal soy face cleanser. This one is just as good. It cleanses my skin well, doesn't make it feel squeaky or dry and feels so good. I like to use it in the morning to remove excess oil or as a gentle cleanser after a more harsh treatment. Highly recommend especially if you love the fresh soy cleansers. Totally love this product. So soft! I also love the smell! Realized the proper way to use it since my last review (make sure skin is completely dry when applying) I love this product. I have extremely sensitive skin and have always had a hard time finding a gentle, yet effective cleanser. It is milky and creamy; no foam. A I’m surprised how how I love this product. It took a minute to past the initial weirdness that I don’t wash my face the traditional way anymore but I’ve been getting a lot of unsolicited comments on how good my skin looks! Love, love this product !!! Very easy to use and does it job well. Best micellar water I used. I removed makeup and leaves skin soft. Not drying or sticky I never used the old version, but this is my first time using any \"water\" skin cleaning product and I love this stuff. I always break out when I am pmsing. I have used this every day and my face is clear for the first time in my life! At first I wasn’t up for the new formula, mostly due to the scent, but after trying it for a couple of weeks, it’s still great. I use this in the morning to lightly cleanse my face. ( deep cleanse regimen is at night) My face haven’t reacted bad to it and it cleanses just as well. The reviews for the reformulation are so surprising to me that I had to sign up just to rate this product and share my experience. I'm not in the beauty industry and I don't know anyone who works in it, I'm just a huge fan of skincare and makeup with clean, safe ingredients. I have used this product for over 2 years as my exclusive second cleanser (following my oil cleanser which I use if I wear any makeup or sunscreen) and both formulas have been fantastic. Tbh I haven't noticed a real difference between the formulas. The other reviewer who called out that the ingredient list is spot on, if you run the new ingredient list through something like CosDNA and analyze the ingredients, it is extremely clean. It's an incredibly effective cleanser and gets off all makeup residue and most importantly, it doesn't burn your eyes when you're using it to clean off mascara/eyeliner/whatever you've got going on. I've tried 10 of the highest rated micellar waters, from high end to \"all natural\", and Dr Jart is hands down the most effective, has the cleanest ingredient list, and leaves your skin feeling clean without stripping it or leaving a weird residue. This is one of my holy grail products and I don't see that changing anytime soon.\n",
      "…read more This product is so awesome it removed all my make up, the IG glam layered baked makeup with out any problems. My skin feels soft , clean and moisturized. Dermaclear Microwater is the best cleansing water I have ever used! I wear contacts and have sensitive eyes. This cleanser is also great on my face. I love that I don't have to use a separate toner if I don't want to. It makes my skin brighter too. A must-have always that does everything! Best micellar water I’ve ever tried! It removes all my makeup and even my lash glue which is almost impossible to remove. Definitely would recommend i dont wear make-up often, but im very lazy to fully wash my face with a cleanser sometimes. so this is a great product to use. especially if you are on the go I also use this with my Clarisonic and love the results, very clean skin, very smooth without over drying.When i use my toner i have nothing left behind. A wonderful product that i have been using for years--i am fifty so that is saying something I have been using Lancôme for over 15 years. I use this cleanser with my Clarisonic and the result is amazing. Clean and fresh without irritation. This is by far the best cleanser I have ever experienced. This product literally makes my face “squeaky clean” - A saying I truly could not relate to until this product, lol. I’ve tried a LOT of cleansers and this one is forever going to be a staple in my skincare routine. My skin is quite dry, but always left feeling soft right after cleansing. It’s a must-try for all! My mom had it on her vanity and I had forgotten my skincare at home and once I tried it I was pleasantly surprised. This cleanser left my skin feeling soft, moisturized and clean. I'm always hesitant to try new cleanser because some can be drying and break me out over time. Also a little goes a long way, if you do happen to use a lot it still doesn't dry out your skin. This is the nicest facial wash. It has a nice Scent, and makes your face feel wonderfully clean and pampered. After rinsing your face feels clean and so soft. Don’t hesitate to buy. You will definitely enjoy. It only takes a very small amount for each use.I will definitely buy again. Gentle for aging skin. It doesn't take much to get a nice lather. Skin feels clean without dryness I love this product, makes my face feel very clean This stuff was amazing! I would definitely buy this over and over again. It’s a product that you hope doesn’t get discontinued. This cleanser is great for my oily t-zone/combination, acne-prone skin. A little goes a long way so it is worth the investment. The cleanser is very creamy and nicely removes my makeup without irritation. It is surprisingly gentle on my skin yet a great cleanser. My skin is much clearer since I have been using this product (over a year now). Highly recommend. I love this stuff so much. It smells good, is gentle on my skin, and a little goes a LONG way. I think it took me 7-8 months to get through one bottle, maybe more. It's helped my acne and is all around such a good product. I have pretty normal skin so this cleanser works well for me. Plus it's so concentrated that I literally take the smallest squeeze, add some water, and it becomes super foamy. I like the fresh scent and it doesn't bother me much. A little goes a long way! I love this product, got it as a sample and had to buy it Love this cleanser. I was using IT cleanser and once I tried this one I fall in love. My skin is very sensitive and dry and this product is not harsh on my skin. A perfect toner to brighten the skin without zapping the moisture. I noticed my skin was consistently smoother and clearer and yet integrating it into my daily routine. In a pinch, I’ve even used this as a setting spray and it was phenomenal. J'adore ce toner! Excellent pour les peaux sensibles. I LOVE this. I use vitamin C to give even out my skin tone and dark spots. I wish I found this sooner. I use this morning and evening and it has done wonders for my skin! I highly recommend this product. Great toner! Smells good. Takes my left over makeup off when needed. I truly believe it has helped keep my skin looking healthy. I tan a lot and live in Colorado where it is extremely dry but this keeps my face looking young. Really like this toner. I have combo/oily skin and I use it after I wash my face and before I apply my moisturizer. Never made me brokeout. Deff would recommend. I've dabbled with toners but wasn't a big toner user but after researching how to up my skin game at 30, this has become a staple in my daily routine. I use it every morning and this wakes my skin up and balances it just right for my daily spf/moisturizer. I have seen some great changes in my skin as it looks clear (just hormonal outbreaks) and and it glows throughout the day. I'm so happy I tried this product! This is a great, non-drying toner. I tried three toners and chose this one. I use to avoid toners because they would dry out my oily dehydrated skin, causing it to be twice as oily. But this toner amazing. Since adding this toner to my skincare routine, my skin hasn’t produced as much oil. I originally bought this because it has vitamin C and antioxidants, and my skin has been glowing ever since. I really like that this toner comes in a spray bottle, because I feel like I’m waisting less because I’m not using a cotton pad. I would highly recommend this.\n",

My skin has a wonderful glow to after application. Especially my face. I would recommend this product to others. Love this toner. Closed my pores and leave me a skin so flawless and Its so easy to use with the mist and smells so good This toner has cleared up my skin and given me that GLOW we’re all craving for right now! It’s a visible difference from before and I even had a break for a month to see if it was this toner that did the magic and dear god did my skin go back to reflecting San Francisco’s gloomy and foggy weather. Buy it, you won’t regret it!! So La Mer is pricey. It’s expensive stuff. I started using the soft lotion in college because my skin was terrible (so many breakouts and huge pores) and it changed my life. I would have loved to use the whole line but I couldn’t afford it. Fast forward to now, I have a little bit of a bigger skincare budget. I love this cleanser. It smells heavenly, cleans so well, and helps manage my breakouts. Is it the best gel cleanser I’ve used? Definitely. It lasts me about 9 months- you only need half a pump for your whole face- and I look forward to cleansing every morning and night. But at the end of the day, it is a luxurious gel cleanser. If I had to go on a still strict budget I would spend it on the soft cream and treatment lotion, both which are life changing. If you can afford this cleanser it’s lovely. But it’s not the best of the la mer line if you’re on a budget. I will continue using this as long as I can afford it!\n",

The sales associate at Nordstrom’s advised me that it is the company that hasn’t been shipping this product due to redoing the packaging l. She was nice enough to give me a few samples of this and I have been using it along with the la Mer cooling cream and my face has never felt or looked so clean and clear. I have rosacea on my cheeks and this cleanser has helped so much with small blemishes and cleared up my skin tremendously. Please!!!! Bring it back so I can get a bottle!!!!\n",
      "…read more Fell in love with this product when I first tried it 4 years ago. It comes in a convenient bottle, where you can control how much product you want. A little, truly goes a long way. Ive has a bottle last me over a year depending on how much makeup I need to take off. It smells fresh without a strong chemical or perfume scent. Lathers up quite well and rinses off easily. The best part is how it makes your face feel. Soft, clean and balanced! Non drying, no tight feeling and not oily. I’ve even had my daughter who breaks out use this cleanser and it’s made a difference. I can tell when she’s not using it. It calms her acne down.\n",
      "…read more This has cleared up my bumps from clogged pores and just given my skin an overall glow. I’m truly in love with this, and won’t ever use anything else. I didn’t think a cleanser would do so much for my skin but I was wrong. I took advantage of the promotion and bought this cleanser - not expecting much - omg this is the best cleanser I’ve ever tried - I already repurchased 2 bottles to stock up. A small amount goes a long way, smells clean and refreshing as well as leaves your skin ready for the following steps. It’s a gel so obviously if you have normal or dry skin this is not for you. BUT for all combination and oily skin types this is a must have!!!!!!!\n",
      "…read more Hate to say it because it’s so pricey! But It’s amazing! It’s expensive but if you can afford it just get it! Squeaky clean Best cleanser I've ever used. It kinda tastes like salt water, if you happen to get a smidge on your lips in the shower, and has a earthy natural scent.. But I love that I can also use it to wash my eye make off and it doesn't harm my lash extensions at all. I've used it for years now. Love it! La mer cleansers really cleans the skin. The gel is no exception. Squeaky clean feeling and using this every morning, the bottle lasts over a year. Always clams my skin. I love this cleanser. I use to have dry skin with the occasional breakout and this cleanser, help stop that. This really gets all the oil, dirt and grime off your face. I know the price in not ideal. But this gets the job done. Absolutely love this cleanser. It’s lasts me a while so it feels like I get me $90 worth. This has been the face wash from my grandmother down to me. The family secret so clear skin! Very soothing use after I exfoliate. Will continue to purchase. Tried mixing with foaming cleanser but did not like. Smells nice and was very creamy. Like how gentle it was on my skin. This is a great product, especially for me because I use the instant foaming cleanser with this! This feels so smooth and gentle on the skin when I start out with this on my skin -almost like an oil cleanser, then moving in and adding a pump of this with a pump of the instant foaming cleanser really makes me feel like I’ve cleansed all the makeup and oil/dirt from the day off of my face without feeling like my skin is dry! Really recommend for people with sensitive skin as well.\n",
      "…read more I'm a big Caudalie fan. I've been using the foaming cleanser for years, but need something a little less drying for the winter months. BUT, like others I don't really like the liquid texture of the cleansing milk, and it doesn't feel like I get all of my make-up off. So I started using my foaming cleanser WITH two squirts of the cleansing milk. It turns my tried and true foaming cleanser into a luxurious creamy foam that gets all of my make-up off and adding a little moisture.\n",
      "…read more As a man who suffers from eczema and combination/oily skin, I have had a difficult time finding a frequent—use cleansing product that doesn’t excessively dry out my skin and contribute to eczema flare ups. After using this for a couple months, I have to say that this hits the nail right on the head. I apply it with a cotton pad and then remove the excess with the Thayer’s witch hazel toner. If I plan to exfoliate, I apply it generously and rinse throughly prior to doing so. If you have eczema, blemish-prone skin and are considering this product, I urge you to purchase and give it a try! You won’t regret it!\n",
      "…read more I love love love this stuff! My new must have to my skin care, it smells amazing (not too harsh) and saved my dry skin!! I double cleanse and this is my go to second step at night-and first in the morning. It’s light, but gives moisture without being oily. In the morning, it refreshes my skin, prior to applying my P50. At night, it gets off what my balm can’t, while quenching my skin. This is an HG for me. I bought this to replace my Pai cleanser. I loved the Pai, but couldn’t justify the price. This has worked as well or better for my very fair, very sensitive skin. No irritation or increase in redness, and I love the smell and texture. Good cleanser, I always use this one. Very gentle on skin. Feels good after I wash my face. Love this cleanser, it’s so gentle on my skin. I have combination skin and every cleanser dried out my skin and this doesn’t at all. This product makes me look forward to cleaning my face!! Gentle cleanser. I use this in the morning. Feels like it's moisturizing my skin. Nice Love, love, love this toner! Great for my dry/combination skin. It really softens my skin and replenishes moisture! Highly recommend This has been amazing for my overall dry skin which is even worse in the cold winters. It truly feels like it works, smells and feels beautiful, too! I use it all the time and will be replacing it when I run out. Really like this product. Smells good as well. I have dry skin and it works fine for me Super gentle and moisturising for sensitive skin, makes my skin feel so soft and clean. This is a well balanced toner for my type of skin! I have thin skin so i am prone to harsh chemical type skincare products. I am also slightly on the dry side so i need good toner as the first step to my skincare regiment that will refresh my skin gently. It does have a stronger fragrance but i dont mind it....it disappears once my skin absorbs it! I have been using this for the last few years and it has been keeping my skin refreshed! I've had no incidences with this toner where i break out and etc....It works perfectly for my skintype so i won't be changing my toner anytime soon! I tried Lancome toner, Skin food toner....but i think this Laneige is the best bang for your buck if you aren't too picky.\n",
      "…read more I had quit using toner years ago, until I got this baby in a sample bag! I have VERY dry/acne prone skin, so finding products that actually accommodate both can be difficult, I was so tired of using products to relieve my dry skin only to break me out 2 days later. This, however; is nothing short of amazing, it seems to help keep my skin hydrated as well as not break me out, I use it morning& evening everyday. I had the 50ml bottled which lasted just short of two months, and am repurchasing the full size! To top it off it has a very light& beautiful scent.\n",
      "…read more Best toner ever! I’ve noticed a huge change since using this toner. I have had sensitivity and dryness issues my whole life. Immediately after my first use of this toner, my skin felt relieved and hydrated. I’ve been using this toner for a year now, and it has become and is continuing to be my go-to toner. My skin no longer feels sensitive or irritated, and I’ve noticed that my skin is much more hydrated. I used to get dry patches around my brows and near my mouth and that doesn’t happen anymore. My skin used to be dry but now it’s more “normal”. I love how this toner makes my skin feel. And not only that, but it smells so good and its such a soothing experience applying this to my skin. I’ve only purchased this 4 times in the past year (I lost a brand new bottle of this once). Each time it has lasted me a good couple months! You don’t need to use a whole lot when you apply it. A small quarter sized amount on a cotton pad gets my whole face, neck and chest. If you have dryness and irritation, try this.\n",
      "…read more Life changing! This toner has forever changed my skin routine and hydrated my skin while toning it so it feels soft and is glowing without feeling stiff or oily. Laneige has given my skin life!!! Life you read me!! I’ve never gotten so many compliments on my skin, from people who are up close and personal like my dentist, doctor, hair stylist, etc... Goes on nice and smooth without drying your skin. I love the smell and the moist glow after it dries before I apply my moisturizer. I notice a more balance skin tone after a few weeks. Great price for the size which goes a long way for any budget. As a mature woman (funny hearing myself say that) I finally understand the importance of having a skin care routine. Bought a small Laneige sample kit and fell in love with the products. Some have said strong perfume smell, but I don’t think so myself. Yes, it has a smell, but I enjoy it, and I can use it at night when I usually have smell sensitivity. My skin feels soft and moist after use. I’ve gone back to find full sizes of the products. It’s light, milky, and very hydrating. After I put this on and let it dry I felt like all my other products “worked better” or applied way more seamlessly! - Absorbs easily - Mild enough for very sensitive skin - No heavy smells - non-drying - As advertised Absolutely blown away by the hydration in this product. My skin is so dry and this makes such a difference. I'm surprised because it's a toner but its more hydrating than most creams i've tried.... lol If you have dry skin, you need this. Feel like this is the best hydrating toner. And for this price and size, I always restock this when in sale. I really like this product because of its moisturizing effect. At first, I thought the toner would be more thin and liquidy where I can use a cotton pad to clean my face, but it is more of a thick and milky consistency. Although the consistency was not what I expected, it really does its job for my dry skin during the winter. Normally after using my cleanser, my skin feels super dry and tight - but my face is completely quenched from this!\n",
      "…read more I love this toner! I have a very sensitive and acne-prone skin. I can’t believe my face actually able to absorb everything of this toner and feel hydrated and refreshed. after. Awesome lightweight moisturizer! Used both as a toner and daytime moisturizer. This toner really saves my skin, especially after cleansing , my skin gets dry and flaky but i put this on and dryness goes away! I feel like my skin has gotten less dry overtime I absolutely love this product. It's affordable and keeps my skin clear and even. Highly recommend! Omg!!! This toner makes your skin sooo soft. I have combo skin and it really balances out my dry patches. 10/10 I normally don't write reviews, but i really just had to for this product. before this, i've tried so many other toners, some for even around the same price category, and nothing could seem to clear my skin in the way that this toner did. i almost gave up in skincare entirely, because nothing could seem to get rid of the breakout i've had on my forehead for two years. not masks, not serums or cleansers, nothing. but not only did this toner make my skin feel really good, it also showed such big results after only 3 days of using it. my skin is visibly brighter, smoother, clearer, and more hydrated than before. it's soft to the touch and it's gotten a lot less oily too. My angry, small whiteheads are FINALLY diminishing and there haven't been any new ones popping up like i've experienced with the last few toners. i'm honestly so glad i gave this a try, and i'll be back to buy a new bottle for sure\n",
      "…read more As someone with constantly oily skin, nothing has helped me more than this toner. The light mint scent just makes this stuff even better! My pores have never felt so clean and fresh, all without that tight/stripped feeling! 10/10 Absolutely. Refreshing! I have used more expensive acne systems in the past but have recently been experimenting with different products and I have definitely become a believer in the brand. I barely wear makeup anymore and I love it! Really has helped clearing up my acne and improving the texture on my face. Have repurchased twice! I noticed my pores are smaller and skin looks healthier- Now I do use the FOREO Luna 3 which is amazing at deep cleansing, but this toner is something special. Amazing!! I have combination skin and it balances everything perfectly while also being super refreshing.I use this following the zero oil cleanser every morning. This is one of those products you actually notice a big difference when you don't use; so worth it!! I have very oily skin and this product does a very good job of keeping my skin less oily over the course of the work day. I recommend this product. At first I was like “why is it so expensive” but it’s literally the best toner ever. At first I used to buy a different toner and I didn’t see a difference. I’ve been using this toner for like 3 or 4 months and I’ve been noticing the difference. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. I love this product!!!! After trying to complete my skincare routine I found that after washing my face it was very oily, this caused me to search for a product to help. When I found this I looked at the reviews and they seemed pretty good so I decided to purchase it. BEST DECISION EVER!! My oily skin GONE. I have seen some reviews that say after applying their skin looks more oily, but you just have to let it really take into effect. It also does not dry my skin which I really enjoy. The only little thing that I would change would be the applicator because when you pour it, it gives a lot, which may be a little bit wasteful of the product. Besides that I LOVE IT!\n",

Not only is it not harsh on my skin, but my skin doesn't feel dried out and tight, but rather clean and refreshed.

Overall my skin just looks and feels better since I've started using it.\n",
      "…read more This is my HG toner. It smells refreshing (very minty, but it dissipates quite quickly if you’re sensitive to smells) and feels even better. My t-zone (my nose especially) gets quite oily while my cheeks are very dry, so finding a toner that I can use everywhere instead of spot treating was quite the challenge. This toner manages it. I use this as my everyday morning and nighttime toner. I have oily/combo skin, and I really dislike how greasy my T zone gets throughout the day. I also have acne prone skin and get hormonal breakouts, so I really like that it has salicylic acid. It does have denatured alcohol, so to offset the drying, my other skincare products are super nourishing and hydrating. I noticed a marked improvement in the appearance of my skin almost immediately. My skin is smooth, soft, and I stay matte all day. This is shaping up to be my holy grail daily toner.\n",

I've been using this for about 2 weeks along with a Drunk Elephant moisturizer and my skin is just glowing. I have dry skin, though it is intended for oily skin, this does not make my dry skin worse. I will continue to use this product and I'm so thankful that it does not break the bank. This toner leaves my skin soft and looking/feeling very healthy.\n",

I use it morning and night followed by the Belief moisture bomb moisturizer and it has changed my skin. I woke up with a breakout one morning and by the next morning it was completely gone. That never happens for me! It also helps balance my skin so I have been far less oily during the day when I have my foundation on.

I have tried everything to just keep it tamed and nothing has worked. I’ve been using this product for only 3 weeks and my skin is almost clear! It honestly mad me cry when I was complimented on my skin the other day. I have super oily and sensitive skin and this is PERFECT for it. I’m so happy this was recommended to me. Best toner for problematic skin, I have finicky skin than tends to breakout with harsh products and this one just works so perfectly with my skin. Its tones and refreshes my skin! This toner works wonders for clearing breakouts and keeping my skin at bay. I have sensitive, combination skin and this is perfect. It also doesn't dry my skin out at all! Added bonus is the clean smell. Absolutely amazing! I have been a die hard belif fan since day one and they never fail to deliver. I got this product bc of my acne/problematic skin and has helped my skin. The tea tree is subtle and there is no alcohol feel if that makes sense. I have combo skin and has worked well for everyday use. It leaves the skin feeling clean but not stripped or dry. I really like this. Very gentle on my sensitive acne prone skin. I love that it has tea tree oil. This is my second bottle of this toner, and it's my favorite! I have adult cystic acne and very dry skin (especially in the winter), and this helps keep it under control. I pat this on every morning and night after cleansing, before moisturizing. Awesome. Reordered twice. Works better than any other toner I’ve ever used. Feels Soothing, calms my redness and acne, doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Plays well with other products. This product line is amazing! I've been using belif products for just over a month now and I can definitely see an improvement in my skin. I have really oily skin that's always red, especially in the morning and evenings. This has helped cut down on the oil. My face feels moisturized but not oily. I've also noticed a significant decrease in redness and blemishes. My face takes a long time to recover from pimples, blemishes, etc. but there's a noticeable difference after using this toner along with some of the other problem solution products. Will definitely keep using this! I can't wait to see how it performs in the summer when I'm out in the heat a humidity all the time. I feel like I've finally found a brand I can stick with!\n",

Hours later my skin still looked so fresh and the only areas looked less oily. It's the first time I purchase this cleanser and I'm very happy with it. I like to switch them up often and I use a pre cleanse before I use this cleanser. I would definitely recommend to combination/normal skin. Even without the clarisonic, my skin still felt fresh and clean after use.\n",
      "…read more I am sooooo happy I took a chance on this face wash. I had never heard of the brand before & didn’t really know where to start to look for a great anti aging face wash but this IS IT! I was looking for something to target fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone/texture/.. and I truly feel like Saturday Skin does it all. It takes off makeup, it hydrates & plumps skin for a dewy fresh glow. It is gentle enough to use on my one year old, is vegan & you only need a dime size amount at a time. I recommend this to everyone & anyone looking for a vegan, plant based amazing YOUTH RESTORING cleanser. I suggest following with Olenherskin Glow 2O Dark Spot Toner, anti-aging serum of choice & AM/PM moisturizer.\n",
      "…read more This a great, gentle cleanser. It doesn’t dry out my skin and it is very lightly scented. I would definitely recommend for an everyday fave wash! As a skincare junkie I’ve used a lot, and I mean A LOT of cleaners and this one is THE best. Once you start using it, it gets super foamy so a little bit goes a long way. Literally a dab is all you need for a full face of bubbles. After rinsing and drying, my face felt velvety soft, and not stripped or dry at all. Plus, it smells great too. Love this cleanser!! This cleaners is amazing. It’s make my skin shine and brighter. I’ll recommend for everybody. I’m looking forward to more products of this brand. The best product to remove your makeup gently! I tried a lot of different oils and balms and they always burn my eyes so much and this product never does. Overall great I love this cleansing oil. I am on my second bottle of it. I use 2 pumps each night. It removes all of my makeup including mascara, without irritating my skin or eyes A little pricey, but It only takes two or three pumps to remove a cake face, a bottle can last for a long time!!! Doesn’t leave any greasy residue, best makeup remover ever period. I love this. It's the best at breaking up waterproof makeup and sunblock! It's very thin and you will need to mix with a bit of water to activate the spread of it. I will definitely be buying this again! Great makeup remover. Doesn’t leave me feeling greasy but does make my skin feel hydrated after using I've been using the oil cleansing method for years but initially got this for traveling and ease of packing. I love that you can twist it closed securely. It smells lovely and removes my makeup completely leaving my skin soft and smooth and never overly stripped or dry. I have combination, sensitive , acne prone skin and was told from a young age to avoid all products containing oil. That was very bad advice and I wish I would have know in my teen years the importance of nurturing and not over stripping my skin! I love this cleansing oil!\n",
      "…read more I don't usually wear a full face of makeup, my every day makeup usually consists of mascara and soap brows. However, I still like to do a double cleanse as I feel like it helps to break up surface debris and prep my skin for water-based cleansers. It has a really pleasant rosemary-ish scent and I like that the ingredients are mostly clean and simple. After trying other oil cleansers and balms at various prices and this one is definitely my favorite in terms of value and quality!\n",
      "…read more I just got this during the VIB Rouge sale and so far I am loving it. I wear very heavy eye make up. Lots of liner, mascara, and eye shadow from everyday to bright vivid colors so a great cleanser is important. I have been on the hunt to find something that will get it all off without a lot of scrubbing, rubbing and tugging on the gentle skin around the eye area. Apply it to a dry face and gently rub it around and over the eyes and watch everything break up and slide off! then go in and scrub and wash your face as normal and rinse clean. It doesn't feel stripping or drying, I also didn't notice any residue. It's a happy purchase for me!\n",
      "…read more I was recommended this face wash after a makeup/skin consultation at Sephora. Honestly, I hated it at first. This idea of this oil-based cleaner running my makeup around my face (making me look like a melted clown) really turned me off. But I stuck with it and began to use it nightly after I ran out of my trusty makeup wipes. This cleanser really gets you clean and removed all of my makeup. I feel so clean, I don’t feel the need to double cleanse as I do with a makeup wipe. I typically use a makeup easer-style cloth to wash off the makeup. I have not yet broken out with this product and my skin doesn’t feel dry or pull after I get done. Once you get over the initial oil and melted makeup look, it will really simplify your nightly routine. I have used nearly the entire bottle. If used regularly, I think a bottle can last between 4-6 months, making it worth your $$\n",
      "…read more This is by far the best 1st step to my double cleanse. I'm 43, have combo skin with dry patches, occasional breakouts and hyperpigmentation and acne scarring. This doesn't make me break out. In fact, when I started double cleansing, it helped reduce my breakouts substantially. I started using this after watching Thataylaa, now Taylor Wynn, on YouTube. It gets all of the mascara and liners off without burning your eyes. Highly recommend!\n",
      "…read more Best cleanser I have tried! I have tried many brands including origins, drunk elephant, Sunday Riley, first aid beauty, belif and many more drugstore brands but nothing compares to this. I cleanses my skin the best way possible and doesn’t leave my skin drying. I love it and I am on my second bottle already. Awesome product. Tried multiple oil cleaners (Tatcha, Amore Pacific, sheseido, Suwahsoo... etc), and this Fresh brand has the best consistency out of all of them. Face doesn’t feel dry afterwards, and skin is pretty clean!! It also didn’t break out my skin. I was reserved to try an oil cleanser because oil + more oil on my skin didn’t make sense to me. However I read that Oil dissolves sebum, and doesn’t strip your natural moisture, that’s why I switched to an oil cleanser and never turned back.\n",
      "…read more I prefer to review products after I have tried a competitor or two. Now that I have, TRUST ME, BUY THIS!!! I've tried another cleansing oil (hated it) and a balm (loved it) but of all three, this is the one I will definitely repurchase. It takes away my foundation, tinted moisturizer, chemical sunscreen, shadow, lipstick/gloss, and (non-waterproof) mascara. Bonus: it's a pump so I don't have to dig into it with my fingers. I will sharing this on my next girls trip so my GFs can experience how quickly this removes everything. It does have a bit of fragrance but I like it even though the guru's suggest we stay away from it. I have been consistently pleased with the Fresh brand and this will definitely remain in my arsenal.\n",

I love how easily this removes my makeup and doesn't leave a filmy residue on my face. Would purchase again. I love them! Perfect for when you don’t have time to wash and exfoliate your face in the mornings. And it didn’t break me out or had an allergic reaction. Definitely worth it Won’t be without these amazing cloths/wipes. I never remove my makeup with them and do cut in half ...... I use them in the morning after I use my NuFace ....takes the gel residue and my nighttime skincare off beautifully with an almost serum-like feel when gently rinsing off. I Love the evenness of my skin after patting dry. This cloth works great for me. My skin feels clean and exfoliated. Does not leave a residue. Got these in my birch box and immediately searched for where to purchase a box. They leave your skin feeling supple and smooth and ready for makeup, but I left the house with just sunscreen after application because I loved the glow they gave me! These are a staple to have in my skin care routine! I do not use these everyday because they are pricey and I take my normal routine fairly seriously, but they are perfect for those lazy nights when you feel like skipping your routine (saving it for the morning after a long day/night) but NEED to remove your makeup. I love the double sided wipe with the exfoliant and how my face feels tingly and somewhat tighter after using it.\n",
      "…read more These cloths remove makeup well and leave your skin soft. Expensive but work better than expected. Love these wipes. Has a soft side for make up removal and textured side for exfoliating. Takes all of my make up off. It is a little stronger than Mac make up wipes. Not for people with sensitive skin Incredible product! The exfoliating beads are way more intense than you would expect on a wipe! My skin felt hydrated and luminous after using them. I. Love. These. Wipes. They are generously sized, remove everything, smell fresh and soft, are moisturizing to the point of not needing to use moisturizer if I'm in a inch - and as a mom of a newborn, having everything in one step is incredibly useful. It's also exfoliating, and the scrubby parts aren't too rough, which I do find with the Sephora charcoal ones. That said, I wish I could afford to have these as my main face wipes. I use wipes when I'm rushing and that happens enough times as a mom with 4 kids. I have the Sephora ones as my main and NuFace as my indulgence.\n",

Also, my son has problems with cystic acne in his jaw line, I have him use one of these before doing a weekly mask and it has helped a lot! I use these when I travel and tear them in half for 2 uses per cloth. Great at keeping me fresh when I fly and get that light exfoliation. LOVE LOVE LOVE! Makes my skin so soft and smooth. Wonderful! THESE ARE A MUST HAVE, EXFOLIATES ON ONE SIDE AND SMOOTH SIDE ON THE OTHER PLUS THEY ARE INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED SO YOU CAN CARRY THEM WITH YOU JUST IN CASE This product is definitely a game changer in terms of quick results and easy use. So easy and practical to use. You feel when you use it that your skin is smooth, exfoliated, that all the impurities are gone and you are ready to either do your makeup to look amazing after such a long week. Your skin looks different, bright, clean, with zero impurities. great product to use 4 times a week, your skin will glow like never before.\n",

Individually wrapped so great for travel or gym bag, but perfect amount of exfoliating and refreshing Really love these cloths they are huge, clean well and don't leave a film. The exfoliating side is just what I needed, feels great and is good for your skin. These are big enough for two uses, I might try cutting them in half and storing in ziplock baggies... Just a thought?!?! I bought the smaller pack first then two of the large boxes . I keep them by my bed and vanity. They make my face soft and clean . It works out one dollar a cloth which is worth it in my opinion . I also carry a couple in my bag for the gym . Just like it says... gentle eye makeup remover. I like it This is the best eye make-up remover I have ever used. I have chronic dry eyes and most removers make my eyes sting and the next day I wake up with major bloodshot eyes. This product does not do this. I have tried so many different eye make-up removers and none have come close to Cliniques! ❤️ Bruno using this product for years. By far the best eye makeup remover. No oily residue. Removes makeup easily. This is my all time favorite eye makeup remover. I’ve experimented with different brands but this one wins hands down. It effortlessly takes off everything, including waterproof mascara. Not irritating to the eyes at all! I’ve been using this product for over 25 years. For awhiike I was unable order or purchase the product online or at Clinique store locations. They discontinued selling the product in Canada untiil I cane acroos it at Sephora on line. I was so happy to find this make up remover as everything else I tried was sub par. Please Clinique, keep this product going. I’ve probably used it longer than 30 years. It takes off make up with irritating my eyes or drying out my skin. Love it! I give it 10 stars!\n",

It lasts a long time and I use it to clean up my eyeliner and stuff. Great Super gentle and effective makeup remover. I have tried all kinds and this is by far best. It's my go to for removing all waterproof makeup. Love it. I've been using this eye make up remover for many years. It is the best product for sensitive and dry skin. I would never change it again. Have tried them all. I always go back to this one. Gentle on my eyes and lashes when removing I was looking for something that would work for my acne-prone and blackhead-ridden face at a reasonable price and I found this soap. I have to say I like it a lot, I use it twice daily on my face and chest and it works to draw out impurities and even the skin tone. It takes a while but it’s gentle and I would recommend it to anyone. I just bought my second bar, first one lasted 3months not bad!! Love this charcoal detox soap bar. I use it on my face when I exfoliate and I bought a separate one for my body! Skin is so clean and smooth. I recommend this product! This is currently my favorite cleanser. It's not too drying for oily skin and removes my makeup well. I don't particularly find that it reduces pore size, but it does help control oil a bit. It is incredibly affordable given that a whole bar lasted me approximately 9 months. It has a light but pleasant scent from the tea tree and bergamot oils as well. This is the 2nd bar I've purchased and I will continue to do so!\n",

I have combination/oily skin with hormonal acne and texture. This cleanser deeply cleans without harshly stripping my skin. I use this as the second step in a double cleanse. On a practical note, I appreciate the minimal packaging this bar soap comes in. I use it twice daily and it lasts around two months. And with a price point so long, I have no complaints!\n",

It stopped my acne right away!! Will continue to use it as my cleanser! The best cleanser that I have ever used! I noticed results within about two weeks! My skin has never been clearer or brighter! So silky! And a little goes a long way. Love this stuff I don't have bad skin to begin with, imperfections and minor blemishes mostly. I could tell a difference in the texture and overall feeling of my skin within days of using. I highly recommend. Love this face wash. It’s made my skin brighter and gets all of my makeup and grime from the day off. I got this over 5 months ago and it’s not close to being done, so the size is well worth the cost! I'm 26 and use this cleanser 2x a day and I love it! My skin is so smooth, free of blemishes, and brighter after using this product. I’m so glad I tried this it’s really helped my skin. I have no more red blotches it’s great and you don’t need to use a tone My favorite cleanser ever! Does a great job keeping my skin clear (I use in conjunction with other Murad Resurgence products). Leave it on a for a minute before rinsing, otherwise, it's just a good cleanser. Letting it sit makes it an A cleanser. I don't find it drying. Love it. Not a big fan of using a face wash as I like something simple (to be honest I'm just lazy) but once you make it a habit, it's easy. Makes my face feel clean and not tight. It's not too thick and doesn't take numerous rinses to get it off. I use the face moisturizer and eye cream too. I'm a big fan now. I have been using this product for several years and would not consider trying anything else. I am a senior and this cleansing creamy product keeps my skin looking and feeling exceptional . I suffer from many skin conditions; cystic acne, acne scarring, rosacea, and extremely oily SENSITIVE skin. The sensitivity of my skin makes me very nervous to try new skincare products, but an esthetician friend recommended this to me so I decided to be brave and give it a try. I wasn't sure how it would work for me because I'm only 25, and this product is generally branded as a product for aged skin, but she assured me that this was great for people like me who deal with adult acne! Boy was she right! My skin has cleared up so much since discovering this product. I am so grateful to feel more confident in my own skin, because it's not an easy thing to do! My texture is more even, the scars look better, breakouts are less frequent, I'm not too dry or too oily, and my skin glows now! I also don't have that insanely tight feeling after washing my face, but it is as soft as a baby's bum! I love this product!\n",

Got a sample and loved it so much ended up buying the full size. It helped with my acne, smoothing dull skin, and radiance. It really helped clean my skin of makeup and residue as well. It cleans well but doesn't strip your skin of moisture or nutrients. Skin is soft and radiant at first wash. Great gentle cleanser. I used to think I was acne prone until I was told I was just beating my skin into submission. I've changed to all gentle products and my skin has never looked better. This cleanser is a key step in being nice to my skin and having it look great. Murad is always premium. LOVE this stuff. Might seem a but expensive at first, but it lasts so long. I use it almost every single day - purchased in May and it is now October and there is still some left in the bottle! I have really sensitive skin so if I come across a \"bad\" product, my skin breaks out and turns red. This stuff has done wonders for my pores and my skin is always left so smooth after. I use this alongside my Clarisonic and have noticed a glow and have gotten SO many compliments on my skin!! Would definitely give this a try if you're on the fence.\n",

I only have been using this cleanser for two weeks and already there is noticable differences in my skins appearance and texture. I had a tan that completely dried out my skin. This cleanser helped to restore the moisture and keep my skin hydrated. My skin is glowing and feels so plump. Excellent cleanser. I love trying new things but this cleanser is one I’m always going to keep. I have sensitive skin and acne marks. This cleanser doesn’t strip my skin. It cleans and refreshes. It doesn’t break me out and it helps in regeneration so that my acne marks get lighter and prevents new breakouts. Yes Yes Yes! That 10% AHA does its job! So glad to find a product that does what it says. I use it once a day before bed. Skin looks great, so smooth now. If I use it anymore, my skin cant tolerate it. I think your only supposed to use it 3x week. I should decrease a bit. Turning into a HG for me. I let it fully absorb before I apply next product. Worth the money here. Amazing! I've never used a product like this before, but I've always struggled with flaky skin in the winter under my foundation no matter how much moisturizer I put on. I put this on before bed and wake up with the softest skin ever. I got this in the FAB Hidden Treasure box and WOW! Within a week my skin is feeling smooth and visibly healthier. FAB products never disappoint! Love this product! My face has never been clearer and more even than when I use this product consistently. A little goes a long way. I use 4-5 times per week. The dropper packaging is helpful to not use too much product at once. I love this serum. Makes my face so smooth. Definitely use this with jade roller for best results. I was searching for a more affordable version of the Drunk Elephant AHA serum and chose to try this one. It has not disappointed! My skin has been rough and raw all week, but I used this overnight with a layer or marula oil on top and my skin is nearly restored in one night! The exfoliation properties in this formula are no joke and they are gentle. My skin is so much happier today, and so am I because of it! Feels like my skin is finally able to breath again, my skin feels so refreshed, clean & smooth! I have combination acne prone skin, and have been getting cystic hormonal kinds terribly this year. I started using this 10% AHA Serum two weeks ago alternating with FAB Facial Radiance Pads, and FAB Acne Clearing Pads with White Clay, I have noticed such a big difference in my skin, it’s like Magic. Actually not magic really, just good clean ingredients which is helping me bring my skin back to life. I have also been using Murad’s Clarifying Cleanser with 1.5% Salicylic Acid which is also awesome! Hope this helps you as much as it has been helping me. If anyone knows of any good products for Acne Treatment than please do recommend, I am open to trying anything that will help my skin become healthy again.\n",

This one says it’s gentle enough for daily use, but I suggest spacing out uses until your skin is accustomed to it. In comparison to The Ordinary one, this stings/burns far less (hardly at all) and is much more effective. Plus, it doesn’t have to be removed like a mask, and is undetectable in the morning.\n",

I have rosacea and my skin is quite sensitive, but at the same time I love chemical exfoliators and collagen boosting ingredients, and this product definitely is that. I use it one day on and one day off and it's effectiveness is not dimmed by any means. It provides skin smoothing and pore cleaning and though it does tingle a bit there are no cons to this product. In fact that tingle just tells me it's working. So if you do have sensitive skin just know this product is well formulated, gentle on the skin, and using it every other night is just as effective as using it every night. Just be sure to use sun protection while using this product as it will make you more photosensitive.\n",

I've been using it for about 2 weeks and haven't noticed any anti aging effects, but I really bought it to keep my oily skin under control which I think it does. All in all, I would buy this again This is a no fuss cleaner that leaves your face clean, but doesn’t leave your face dry. My face is squeaky clean, but soft . . . and the smell of the product is lovely- not like perfume, but a walk in a meadow after a rain. It’s definitely worth the price and a little goes a long way. My second fav cleanser! My skin is sensitive and oily in the T-zone. I struggle with finding a cleanser that leaves my skin feeling clean without it feeling stripped. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and balanced. Works great and leaves my skin feeling wonderful! I am super impressed with this formula cleanser by Origins! I purchased this and within ONE day, saw the 2 breakouts I had, disappear. It leaves my face feeling very clean and its gentle enough to not irritate my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this product! I'm definitely investing in the remainder of the skincare line-up! I can’t say enough good things about this cleanser. It strips it all off with no need for a makeup remover. The only thing I have to use is a eye mkeup remover for my waterproof mascara. This cleanser releases dead cells and leaves skin looking so youthful and smooth! The anti-aging aspect is just a plus. I love how it gets all frothy and it only takes a tiny drop to clean your whole face. That means you get a lot of use out of this product and your stretch your money! One of these can almost last me a year!\n",

Fantastic cleanser for my combination skin. I’m very pleased with this purchase and will likely buy again. Not drying for me at all and very luxurious and foamy. I love this product, it is super soft and the perfume is very nice. I never really write reviews, but had to for this one. I LOVE this product - i have been looking for a foaming face cleanser that doesnt strip my skin of moisture (especially during the dry winters).

I have super dry and sensitive skin, especially in the winter season. This face wash did not irritate my skin in anyway or strip my face of its natural moisture. Very pleased with it. This is the best face cleanser possible for sensitive skin. After months of searching, I finally found something that works with my skin and gives it a balanced, brighter look. I highly recommend it! I've tried many cleansers from drugstore to very high end. I really like this product. It left my face clean and makeup free with zero tightness. Balances the skin nicely, which is what you want in a cleanser. The light rose scent is lovely, if you like rose. Highly recommend. Great product. Nice and soft skin after I used it and very gentle on my sensitive skin. I love it so much that I will buy the moisturizer as well next time. I'm a fan of Fresh products anyway so when I stumbled across this cleansing foam I was pumped! The rose scent to the product isn't overwhelming but you can tell its there and its pleasant! I felt very refreshed after using this in the mornings and it helps me wind down in the evenings. Great product and size for the price! Definitely worth the purchase! I fell in love with the rose cream and was stoked when Fresh came out with a Rose Cleansing Foam. The smell is heavenly and it is super gently but also thoroughly cleans my sensitive skin. I actually get excited to wash my face! Loved the soft foam which gently cleans and leaves fresh feeling and pleasant scent. I highly recommended this product is totally light and clean perfectly your skin. Cooling and refreshing, does not leave a residue or texture to my skin. This does not smell bad at all, if purchased in the martian pack they're definitely referring to the mask, not this. I’ve been using this for more than a year it has changed my skincare routine so much. Pairing this with the UFO oil into my skincare routine has made all the difference in my skin. It smells weird but clean it is something I will continue to buy. Great for combo/oily skin! the 1 star reviews because of smell make me so sad!!! This product is incredible; the ingredients, the results, the pump, everything. I’m oily and acne prone and this has been a godsend, I use it with UFO and my skin has cleared up significantly. Some of the best skincare smells ‘weird’ because of the incredible ingredients and lack of artificial fragrances. Thank you Sunday Riley for another amazing product!\n",

Pairs great with the Kiehl’s Cannabis seed oil concentrate! This is my favorite cleaners from Kiehl’s. If you have oily skin this is for you. I doesn’t dry out my face at all. I have severe acne and this face wash and aloe Vera before bed completely cleared up my skin! I highly recommend using this if you have mild to severe acne. My skin is also somewhat sensitive and I never had an issue with it It’s a gentle cleanser that has greatly reduced my breakouts. I have only been using it for a little over 3 weeks but it really works. I love it! I will be buying it again. I've used this cleanser daily for about six months and have had far less breakouts! This is not a miracle product that can clear acne perfectly by itself, BUT I've used it to maintain clear skin in corporation with other treatments. It's a gentle cleanser that can be used year-round as a staple in your routine; it's been the one I reach for the most, and the cleanser I always pack for traveling. Plus it smells really earthy and soothing!\n",

No new break outs since trying this cleanser!! Works really well I want to begin by reminding everyone that there is no universal product that works for everyone! That being said, I have tried a plethora of face washes (from mild to proactive) to combat my acne and this seems to be the first product that has really worked. I have combination sensative skin that easily dries out and becomes painful. The Blue Herbal Cleanser has yet to dry my skin and has notable shrunk my current spots and has helped keep the rest of my skin clear! Again, there will always be mixed reviews when it comes to products striving to combat acne. This one really worked for me!\n",
      "…read more This is the only thing that has helped to clear my acne! I use this twice a day and i've used it for a month straight. My skin has never looked clearer. Make sure that you massage it in for a while and then rinse it off completely because it can have a strange residue if you don't. It is very cooling and when used with the Blue Herbal Toner and the acne spot treatment my acne is almost gone and my skin isn't even dry!\n",
      "…read more This smells amazing and has really cleaned clear up my skin. Going to definitely repurchase I’ve tried almost every acne cleanser under the sun and this one has worked the best! While not getting rid of my acne completely it has changed my face for sure. Friends ask what I’ve done to change my skin routine and I mention this. Definitely my new go to cleanser. I liked this cleanser because my face feels clean from all the excess oil. My face is starting to glow more. I would recommend it for acne and oily skin. I use this cleansing balm every morning. It is very creamy, gentle, and smells delicious. It is a wonderful way to start the day, especially in the winter when the air is dry. I highly recommend. I will use it forever! Why isn't everyone talking about this stuff? This is amazing! As a cleanser or a mask, it's AMAZING. I had to buy a travel size jar to take it with me. Not sure if I reviewed this when I originally started using it last year, but I just restocked so am writing a review. This time of year my skin gets especially dry. The way I use this cleanser is I put it on and then go about my business for like ten minutes or 20 if I am especially dry, and then I take alittle warm water and do circular motions and then I rinse it off with warm water This is one of the best products I’ve ever purchased. So many ways to use it and after about a week of using it I started getting compliments on my glowing skin! LOVE. I can wear this product before bed or moisturize during the day and I swear I have never gotten more compliments on my skin! It looks dewy, hydrated and healthy. Super into it. A little goes a long way too - and package is quite large. Worth the price. I am absolutely in LOVE with this. It has a very nice super subtle scent. I never use it as a cleanser or ‘SOS balm’ because I find it WAYYYY more effective to use as an overnight mask. A little goes on a long way as well making it 100% worth the price. Container is bulky but also super super pretty cover your entire face in a thin film of this and in the morning when you wash your face your skin will feel very soft and redness (if u have any) will be reduced. If you use every night for about a week you will see a significant difference in your complexion. IF YOURE HESITATING TO BUY THIS DO IT!\n",
      "…read more A daily staple. Pulls the make up off effortlessly. I apply this before I take my shower. It has time to penetrate the skin. Amazing. It is may all time favorite make-up remover but I also use it at night as a night cream. It is my favorite buy on Sephora for 2018. A little goes a long way. Love this cleanser so much. The smell is balanced and not overpowering, works really effectively, my skin feels clean and oh so soft after I use it. This cleanser truly is magical. Container is large and I feel like I’m getting my money’s worth. Will be buying it again! THE BEST CLEANSING BALM. I’ve tried Elemis, Estée Lauder, Omorovicza, Colleen Rothschild, etc. The best part is you don’t even need a second cleanser like the others. The smell is divine. I would like to embalm myself in this when I die. Lol I spread this all over and put a warm cloth over my face and breathe in for a few minutes before wiping everything off. HG status for me after trying countless others.\n",
      "…read more This is an exceptional, versatile product. I’ve used it to remove makeup and to moisturize my face when I have patchy areas. I’ve used this balm under my eyes at night for extra moisture in the winter months or when I’m wearing concealer too much! You can use it for lip balm, on your cuticles.... you can mix it with pigments, it’s really limitless!! I was also beyond pleased with the size of this container. I’ve been using samples and travel sizes for a while since a little goes a long way. I was NOT expecting this massive container, so now I want to just put it all over my body! Haha buy this stuff! You won’t regret it.\n",
      "…read more I absolutely love this product! It’s the ultimate multitasker! It boosts your skin with so much hydration and it smells like jasmine heaven! I use this as a joint body moisturizer, so on my ankles, knees, elbows, neck, and anywhere else that needs an incredible amount of emollient moisture. I use it the most as a sleeping mask and I actually prefer this more than the Night Magic Cream because it’s more hydrating and leaves my skin baby soft in the morning and my pores look visibly smaller. Over time, my skin looks more healthy and glowing and I have fewer breakouts! For the size and performance, it’s worth every penny and it will last you the year (or later)!\n",
      "…read more Words can not describe how amazing Muslin cloths are! I read an article in Vogue about using these to remove makeup, in place of standard cloths, Clarisonic, etc., so I decided to give them a \"go!\" I WILL NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE AGAIN!!!! You know how well it works because, after cleansing with these, I use my toner and my cotton round is completely clear! Besides them removing every drop of makeup, my favorite thing is, they dry extremely quick!!! Which is great so you're not dealing with moldy particles that can arise on your cloths during the day, before using it again at night, and your makeup rinses out very well after use. I just rinse it will cool water, ring it out and place over my sink or a towel rack. Honestly, there are other brands out there that are cheaper, smaller, and more quantity in a pack. I typically buy two packs every other month then either toss them out or save them for cleaning my dog's eye boogers and ears. ha!\n",
      "…read more A game changer!!! Leaves my sling very smooth, clean and gives a healthy shine, while removing every single piece of a makeup. I use it with eve Lom cleanser, the texture was a bit unusual in the beginning, now I got used to and honestly makes a huge difference. Thank you to my friend who introduced me to this product. I can not stop raving about how great this cloth is and what a difference it made to my skin. A very well deserved 5 stars!\n",
      "…read more These cloths are perfect for swiping off thick face masks without scrubbing. They lift off Drunk Elephant Baby Facial perfectly. They rinse and wash well, and don’t seem prone to staining. I initially thought it was overpriced hype but once I tried them I live them!!!! I’ve shared the 3 pack with my sister who also loves them. I use it with my Clinique foaming cleanser, I lather my face first then wipe in a circular motion to help it exfoliate and remove all the makeup from my face. With daily, nightly use I’ve noticed my skin glows after each wash and my face serum absorbs easier into my skin helps my complexion look smoother and brighter. Worth the purchase.\n",
      "…read more I bought this one to replace a cloth I bought in japan - this is the most similar product i could found in the US - which gives a really clean skin and physically remove the residues, dead skin etc. make the face look so refreshed. Initially before buying these I was hesitant as I thought how outrageous they were priced... I mean $29 for 3 little face cloths! Let me just say they are worth it! I love these and I now can’t use anything else. They are bigger in size than a regular wash cloth. These are also very thin, in a good way... they allow for easy movement and use of the cloth. They are a bit scratchy... in a good way, I believe they are like this to help get your skin super clean and to help with exfoliation. They wash up great, I just throw mine in the washer/dryer and so far they have held up well it’s been about 2 months, maybe just a bit less. Bottom line is they are wonderful, you won’t regret this purchase, and yes, you need these.\n",
      "…read more Love these clothes to use as a finishing touch to cleanse my face. They are light and dry quickly. Ever since i started using this with the eve lom cleanser, i won't be going back to old methods or products that i have used in the past for cleaning my face. This is a gentle yet effective at cleaning your face. I typically run this over hot water, rinse the water sand quickly put it over my face, it wont be hot on your face because it cools down quick. This helps open my pores and get rid of the yuckiness that accumulates on my face throughout the day. After doing this 3 times with hot water, i run it through super cold water, rinse and lay the cloth on my face. It feels amazing and my face looks very bright after. A very important step in my night and day skin care routine! LOVE\n",
      "…read more I have been trying to replace single-use items in my routine to practice a more sustainable lifestyle; these cloths are my replacement for/extension of the life of my clarisonic brush heads. They're perfect for a mild exfoliation, they don't smell musty if you leave them in the shower (like some washcloths), and they easily rinse out makeup and other stain-inducing products so I have a white towel after everytime I use them. I can leave them in the shower for a week or so before I feel like I need to wash them. They're really soft and my cleansers still foam up when I use these cloths to wash my face. I have washed them a few times already and they've held up nicely with no fraying or tearing. They do shrink a bit in the dryer, but when you wet them, they return to their original size.\n",
      "…read more Amazing. Leaves skin smooth and clean! holy grail!! Absolutely amazing! Great way to exfoliate lightly! If I’m not using my hands, I’m using this cloth! Works really well, dried quickly. I prefer this using any cleansing tool. Ohhh, I love these and what they do to my skin. Used with the Eve Lom cleanser, you just get the best skin. I feel like I’ve had a facial after! I felt like a crazy when I decided to spend $20+ for a freakin muslin cloth. After using it for 2 weeks, I’m glad I made that decision! My acne improved significantly, blackhead and whitehead started to diminish, and now I have clearer skin than ever! I don’t even use the Eve Lom cleanser, I just use a gentle cleanser from drugstore. I don’t need to spend more on cotton pad as well. Worth the investment!\n",
      "…read more Love these cloths! I read about how these cloths are a total game changer on Into the Gloss, and the blog was correct! It is pretty good hydrating toner. Love the smell . I use it in the morning. Will repurchase This has been a staple in my skincare routine since my teen years. My mom introduced me to it, and I've continued to use it as an adult. Great way to prep the skin. love this Lancôme product, nothing compares, the smell is awesome! I really like this toner. It smells so good and is very hydrating for my dry/combo skin. Will be repurchasing when I run out (: Gentle on skin. Nicely scented and great product I love this toner. It’s really nice to my skin and has a nice smell. It's absurd to spend this much on toner but I keep buying it because it smells so good. It helps me a lot! I truly recommend this product, i used it at the end of my day as as refreshing tonique. I've been using this for a few weeks and ready to review it. I was using the Elizabeth Arden Age Revitalizing tonic which was very gentle and soft on my dry, sensitive skin so I was nervous to replace it with something else. But this has been a God-send. It is gentle, doesn't have an overpowering smell and always removes more makeup even after I double cleanse. I always moisturize after using this and it helps the moisturizer or facial oil absorb better. If you have skin like me, I definitely recommend this.\n",
      "…read more Love love this toner. It makes my pimples smaller the next day!! I bought this toner because it is alcohol free. It smells floral and really removes any excess foundation. The next morning my skin definitely looks more glowing and hydrated and it even seems to help reduce acne slightly! I will keep using this toner! I have oily skin. I got a sample size from Lamcôme in a free gift bag. I love this toner. I was so excited to see Sephora had it. It’s not harsh on my skin and it doesn’t leave my face feeling dry afterwards like most toners. It leaves it feeling so smooth and soft. Has a very light fragrance to it, making me feel refreshed without the alcohol. Works well on my skin. Leaves my face super clean. Takes off most of my makeup. I love this cleanser. It's light weight and takes off allll my make up at the end of the day! Super creamy foam, gets the majority of my make up off and doesn’t irritate or dry my skin out. Will probably buy again once I am out! I love this product. This tube lasted my about 6 months, you only need a little. Its worth the price, I suggest using there moisturizer or aqua bomb sleeping mask after using this to keep your face hydrated Love love this product! My face feels so amazing and refreshed after washing it. This cleanser has cleared my acne prone skin like nothing else. I love the lather, and how this product leaves my skin feeling clean but not that awful squeaky clean. I love love love this cleanser. A little bit goes such a long way. All you need is a pinch and it foams up and cleans your entire face and neck. I also love the fact that is non-drying. It’s by far my favorite cleanser. I’ve been using the travel size and that one last forever. Only buying the full-size one during the VIB sale. Removes make up and build up easily! Gets a good foam going. Lasts about 2/3 months with daily use. Would recommend. I use this cleanser every morning and night before bed on my face, back and chest. You only need a small amount of product. My skin/pores have honestly drastically changed for the better. One of my favorite products. I stopped using this cleanser. Year ago and started using random cleansers. I realized my face wasn’t feeling as clean. So I went back and bought this cleanser. Immediately felt that clean, fresh and soft skin again. Its doesn’t dry out my areas around lips.. retains the moisture.. love it This is my favorite face cleanser! You only need to use a very very very tiny amount and it foams up and becomes a great lather for your face. It removes all of my make up so well. One bottle can last you a very long time because you only need a very very small amount to remove all the make up and oils off your face. Holy grail face cleanser for me! My face feels clean and not too dry after using. It’s perfect. A little goes a long way and this soap gets really foamy (which I love!) My skin doesn't feel dry or stripped after rinsing and it doesn't really have a scent. I started using this toner once at night about 2 weeks ago and the results were so phenomenal I ditched my morning toner and switched to this one twice daily. My face looks amazing! I’ve been struggling with breakouts and hormonal acne and this is helping tremendously! This has now become my holy grail of toner! First of all, an essence that’s less than $50? Sold. The white tea leaves a beautiful soft scent and gives antioxidants for anybody who is looking for a preventative product. Origins has been an OG clean brand for so long and it’s often overlooked! So glad I found this gem. LOVE this toner. It's my favorite for the morning because it smells so wonderful and leaves my skin feeling fresh and bright. It's not too harsh so I don't feel dried out, but really helps set the stage for all of my other skin products. I went into Sephora looking for a toner and an employee suggested this product. I was hesitant because I've never used the brand and honestly just bought because the bottle says it stays good for 24 months. I use this twice a day, ahead of my regular skincare routine and makeup application. I like that it's light and doesn't make me greasy before applying makeup. It feels refreshing and soaks in almost instantly. I don't love the style of the container, I wish it was a mist or was easier to apply (you need a cotton ball or something similar to apply), but other than that I have no complaints.\n",
      "…read more After recently moving to a desert environment, my skin drastically changed. I could feel and literally see my skin drying up and peeling. I purchased this because the description intrigued me as it claims to not only hydrate but protect your skin. I’m not a skin expert but I definitely agree with the claims. My skin was instantly hydrated, I can’t stand when my face feels dry or even remotely taut. In addition, it wasn’t a temporary feeling, rather I felt the hydration last all day. Some days it’s windy and dirt sometimes hits my face (gross I know) especially since I enjoy walking outdoors a lot, and my face isn’t as nasty when I wash it off in the evening. Not sure how true that is but I’m so in love with this toner that I believe it lol. Anyways I usually apply this with a cotton pad but it seems I’m almost halfway done in about 2 months unfortunately, though I could be applying more than the average person. I love the fact it’s a clean product, yet effective. I also want to attribute my recent confidence boost in less make-up days to this product (as well as the new Sephora vitamin C serum and moisturizer) because my skin has been looking so clear and even in skin tone. I’m in love!\n",
      "…read more This product is great in helping to even out skin tone I did not get this to help with break outs and it isn’t advertised as something that will help with that but I swear if I have a pimple it is significantly smaller or gone the next morning! If I don’t use this for a few nights I can tell a noticeable difference the first time I use this again! I wasn’t expecting it to be anything great when I bought it, just a good daily toner, but I really feel it has done lots of things for my skin. Beautiful product! Ive tried all types of toners and this is it!!!! I love love love it! I just wish there was a travel size one to take with me when i travel! This is a great product. Really made a difference in the appearance of my skin. I’ve been using this toner for many years - it’s the best! Smells good, not too drying, natural ingredients and not too expensive. I highly recommend it! This is a great eye make up remover extensive always an absolutely hate when I make up remover‘s leave the greasy oily residue on your eyes and make your eyes blurry this does none of that it removes the toughest Waterproof mascara. Just pour some on a cotton pad with the cotton pad on your closed I for five seconds and then gently wipe and your waterproof mascara and waterproof eyeliner will mediately come off this product is similar to the Dior I make up remover but it is just more reasonable cost\n",
      "…read more I had always used the Lancôme Bi-facil remover since I only use waterproof mascara. I tried this and fell in love. Compared to the Lancôme, this feels really gentle on the eyes while still being very effective. I have sensitive eyes too and this didn’t irritate them at all and it doesn’t leave an oily film. This is my first choice for waterproof mascara remover. I have also recently tried the Glossier one and quite liked that as well. I will say that’s my 2nd choice and Lancôme now my 3rd. The bottle is great too - easy to squeeze out every bit and good for travel.\n",
      "…read more God, I love this, even though it's expensive and I run through it far too quickly. Of all the bi-phase eye makeup removers, this is the one that leaves the least amount of oily residue on the eyes. It's gentle, doesn't burn, and smells pleasant. Really love this make up remover! It conditions ur lashes really well and it’s my favorite for getting off that stubborn waterproof eyeliner that other removers can miss.. also smells great (rose oil) n leaves skin very soft! I am happy with this product. It's not oily and does a good job in removing eye makeup. I would purchase it again. At that price, my makeup remover better be good. And it is! The makeup goes off instantly and there's no residue... I don't have to rub my eye a bunch. It smells amazing, but the odour is a little strong. Best eye makeup remover! Love the smell too it removes my eye makeup in a second. I have been using this eye makeup remover for years. It is gentle and removes all my mascara, eyeliner, shadow, etc. without irritating my eyes or causing eyelash fallout. This product also removes waterproof makeup easily! Hopefully it is never discontinued. This toner is really hydrating and soothing, very refreshing on the skin and a great prep step before serums. My skin has been breaking out terribly ever since spring started this year. It was extremely oily but felt very dehydrated at the same time. After doing some research I decided to look for a toner with no alcohol in it. I also wanted to find a toner that didn't contain any oils (oils ALWAYS end up inevitably breaking out my sensitive/oily skin). Searching for these two things led me to this toner, and let me tell you, I could not be happier that it did! The second I put this toner on it felt like my skin took a nice long cool drink of water it so desperately needed. My skin immediately felt smoother and plump. After a few days of using this toner my skin started clearing up, and what acne is left is significantly reduced and less red. This is the first time I've ever tried an Algenist product and I have to say I am very impressed and will be repurchasing, and also exploring their full line!\n",
      "…read more Love this toner! Makes my skin feel hydrated and clean. It’s been a struggle for me to find something suitable for my sensitive skin and this is perfect. Wow. I was a loyal buyer of Mario badescu toner until this. This is my holy grail. I have cystic acne and fine lines on my forehead and this definitely smoothed out my skin. I’m obsessed. Wish it came in a spray bottle but overall great toner. Smells great and leaves skin feeling supple , clean and refreshed. I like it it’s vary good hydrating toner Use this twice daily, does not have a strong fragrance and doesn’t leave your skin dry. Love it- cleans my skin both immediately and over time. I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS BUT THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING! This stuff works wonders fast! I though ok now toner is “essence” and it’s just another expensive item that I don’t need to add to my skin regime. I never noticed any difference in my skin using a toner in the past but this product proved me wrong within 2 days of using this and adding the Face Hero skin oil before moisturizing all of my pores are 90 cleared out and shrunken! My skin texture has improved more in 2 days than months of other products. On week 2 and I’m still amazed.\n",
      "…read more This stuff is amazing! Every exfoliant I’ve ever used has made me break out, so the gentle formula in this works perfectly for my sensitive skin. I’m left soft and glowing ✨✨ it smells suuuper earthy, not great, but I don’t get the cigarette smell others have been saying. This product gets your skin so smooth it’s the best exfoliants! The product cleans your face so well or wherever you use it that all the dead skin cells come right off and it makes your face feel like a baby’s bottom. I immediately use my Fresh rose deep hydration facial toner after this product and then I go in with my La Mer Moisturizing Creme to finish it off to rejuvenate my skin before I sleep. This is truly the best exfoliant!\n",
      "…read more Smooth and light. Makes my feel fresh and super clean . What I most like about it is that a little goes a long way and I don’t need to rinse twice to clean everything. Will purchase again. I suffer from very sensitive skin and dry skin. This didn’t cause an itchy rash. It helped remove my dry skin. I would recommend this for others with sensitive skin. I have super irritated skin. I don't get many breakouts, but I do have lots of redness. This product exfoliates my skin perfectly and leaves my face softer and brighter than before, without irritating it. I like to use this at night and follow with a light moisturizer. I’m in love with all products from FAB! I have extremely sensitive skin and oily skin and i use FAB complete line and the changes are amazing. This is mu fave scrub so soft to the touch and non abrasive Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean, not too strong of a scent. I use it with my reusable facial rounds and it still works perfectly. Love this product I’ve purchased this twice— I have dry sensitive skin that’s prone to allergic reactions and this doesn’t burn or cause any irritation! Will be purchasing again! I've been looking for a good toner that doesn't feel heavy or too astringent and this one is great! I used Kiehl's regular toner for a few years and just changed to this one. I have Rosacea and thought maybe the most gentle toner would be better. I like it a lot and plan to continue to buy the cucumber version. This is a great toner for combination skin, I noticed my skin looked way better while using this product. The Kiehl's line is by far my favorite! I have dry skin and I started to use this toner on my daily routine and it worked really good definitely close my pores. I love this stuff. It has definitely been a part of my holy grail for a year or so now. There is no alcohol in this so it doesn’t dry out my skin. I look forward to using this in the morning because it feels refreshing to me and seems to wake me up a bit. A friend recommended this and I swear this scrub makes my skin sparkle. I use once a week and try to time it with a night out or big meeting because my skin looks amazing that day. Love it so far. Buffs and removes. Doesn’t dry out my already dehydrated skin like many other brightening/exfoliating products. Other people said it was rough on the skin but that hasn’t been my experience. It’s a little sticky so I’ve been using it in the shower which has been working nicely. I absolutely love this! It is so gritty without being aggravating to my skin. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and does not leave it dry. Also a small amount goes a long way! My skin is more sensitive from the cold during the winter. I bought this brightening polish based on a recommendation from a friend. I use it once a week before applying a hydrating mask. I find that it exfoliates effectively but is gentle enough that it does not irritate my skin. I love this polish! It clears my skin & makes my skin feel great after each use! I’m addicted! My skin is very, very soft after using this scrub. I’ve only used it on my fave and I enjoy it a lot. Love this stuff - best physical exfoliator I’ve ever used. The turmeric in it really makes your face GLOW. Wish I could find a turmeric serum or moisturizer so that I could get that glow daily! I have purchased this two or three times and like it very much. It is not too gritty or too greasy and if you massage gently it leaves the skin with a lovely light glow and ready for moisturizer. Best 2 minute mask I have ever used. I have dry flaky skin, and this helped scrub away my dead skin leaving my face soft as butter! Not rough on the skin and I get a refreshed moisturized feel after applying. Will purchase again I had a good result with one use of this. My skin feels smooth and clean, but not moisturized and clearly in one go you can’t expect fading spots. I like consistence and gel time and granules are just the right size. A must!!! I’ve gotten my friends hooked and we all have different skin types. I recommend this scrub before an event or for a refresh. You can’t go wrong with turmeric which is an anti-inflammatory and literally makes me glow. Get the MOST glow by using your vitamin C serum after using this product. I can tell a huge difference when I stop using it and compliments when I use it regularly. Definitely pricey for the body but face and décolletage definitely. This is not a moisturizing scrub but an amazing starter for the rest of your routine. :) Do it!\n",
      "…read more I love how soft my skin was after using it. Not drying either. I always come back to this eye makeup remover. So gentle yet effective. Doesn't burn my eyes and doesn't have a weird smell. Love it! Make it cheaper! My holy grail eye makeup remover. Does a great job of removing waterproof and long wearing makeup. It's a bit oily, but doesn't burn my eyes at all. A bottle typically lasts 2 months with regular makeup wear. I only use it on my eyes and sometimes liquid lipstick. I keep coming back to this remover - it's gentle and it works. All of my eye makeup is water resistant, and this takes it off without having to rub at my eyes. IMO it's much better than Lancome's. Received as a sample and I’ve been in love ever since. Had to order because it was never available in stores I loveeee this makeup remover!!!! I honestly wish they sold a huge bottle cause I would purchase! It is a little pricey but it removes EVERYTHING and it doesnt irritate my eyes. this is one of very few products that i buy again and again. it removes eye makeup easily and gently, with no oily residue and no film on your eyes after use. This is by far the best makeup remover I've ever used. I will never buy another brand! I can only use waterproof mascara because others won't hold a curl. That being said, i hate products that make me tug and pull to remove the waterproof mascara. This product removed instantly without having to tug and pull. It also does not irritate my eyes, which tend to be easily irritated by anything I put near them. Absolutely love this!\n",
      "…read more I have been using the Clarifying Lotion 1 for about 2 weeks and I definitely see that it is loosening the dead skin on my face! However it doesn't remove it. I have to exfoliate. I have very dry skin and live in a very dry climate. It doesn't sting and doesn't dry my skin. YAY!! I really love this product. I have dry skin but when I apply it on my face I don’t feel my skin over dry. It take off all the impurities that the cleanser didn’t do. I feel my skin smooth and cleaned. I have used a few bottles of this and find it awesome for my dry/combo skin. I usually use it in the morning with a cotton pad INSTEAD OF cleanser to avoid over cleansing my face. It removes overnight buildups without drying my skin (still need to properly moisturize afterwards) and the cooling sensation wakes me up. A Must Have! Fights acne and excess oil but not overdrying. Many toners dry me out too much but not this one! Even if you're combination skin I would recommend this one, not the level 2 toner. If you're *very* oily consistently then maybe the level 2 is better for you, but this one does the job quite well. Seems to work well for me without being drying. The three step process has really helped my skin. I use this every night after cleansing, before moisturizer. It's amazing to see what this toner takes off that the cleansers leave on your skin. I use this back and forth with the Clinique number 2 clarifying lotion, as that one's a bit harsher. This one however, I can use every day and it's not too strong on my skin. Amazing product. This is one of the better cleansers/toners I’ve used, definitely gentle but gets the job done! I’ve been using this with the Redness Solutions Cleanser and Moisturizer and it has helped calm my redness so much! It has also done a lot for my texture as well, my skin looks a lot smoother than before. I have combination skin. Mostly dry and sensitive. As a person that ALWAYS routinely moisturizes morning and night I give this 5 stars. I cant start the day without moisturizing my skin, if I don't it feels tight and leathery. I put this on in replace to my moisturizer for the day as I was running late for work and it worked perfect had no problems. I break out very easy if I use new products so I was hesitant to buy this but when I got matched for my foundation a few weeks back the gal put this on my face. I really liked it a lot, it was light weight and I noticed my face didn't spaz out. After this one I might try to others to see which one I like better. I did noticed my face was smoother and more glow like and my dark spots/redness seemed lighter . I think the only con to this is that they should come up with an applier for this. I just get little pads or fluff balls and those do the trick too! This picture is me this morning after I put it on-without makeup just mascara, feels nice and fresh! I struggle with dark spots and my former acne aftermath and this stuff works great :)!\n",

EVERYONE NEEDS THIS! This clarifying has work so far, my skin look cleaner, less red and it doesnt dry my skin, I have noticed that my rosacea somehow it hasnt flared up which makes me happy because I was very skeptical about trying a toner, but I can tell the difference on my skin! Use this every day after cleansing. Does not dry out skin even in the winter I enjoy applying this product, it wakes me up in the morning. Great product, moisturizers without feeling greasy. My favorite toner prefect for dry skin. I see some saying they have combo might want a different number. If your combo with dry it should be number 2 if your combo with oily it should be 3 This is the most gentle of the clarifying lotions, and I use it once per day. I notice when I regularly use it I don't get blackheads on my nose or chin. They suggest using it 2x per day, but I have highly sensitive, fair skin, and that seems to be a bit much, so I only use it once a day at night. Always the best. I've been using it for years. A must have in any lady's facial line-up. Forever young! I love this product. So simple to use. Has really helped with how oily my t zone can get. I can’t compare this much to other toners quality wise, because I haven’t tried that many. But convenience wise, I love this toner. I feel like I’m wasting product with liquid toners and cotton pads, but stick toner just goes straight on my face so I can’t waste it. I stopped using toners for a while, then picked this one up and I’m glad to have toner back in my routine. My skin condition has improved. My skin stays moisturized longer. I am pleasantly surprised with the amount of moisture already in the stick toner. I usually apply it on clean, but slightly wet skin. But I have applied it after my skin dried off completely (after cleansing) and it still goes on so smooth.\n",
      "…read more I love this toner!! I got this as my first toner and I can confidently say that it has toned my skin! I love the stick application, providing a easy application with no extra mess. If you need a extremely refreshing toner, this one is the one for you! LOVE IT! Love love love this toner! I’m lazy with my skincare routine so I’ve always skipped the toner step. This is so easy to just roll on my face I never skip it! Since using it for a month or two my skin has been clearer and looks overall healthier. It’s a bit sticky when you first put it on but I normally do so at night so it’s not an issue for me. In love with this toner! (and almost anything from Milk) Its insanely easy to travel with, since its solid you can't get dinged for it when flying and NO LEAKS! Plus it feels great on my skin; I have a fairly simple/low maintenance skin care routine full of clean products and this is fab addition. I take the stick over my damp skin then rub/press it in with my fingers afterwards.. then repeat! (yes, I tone twice! Recently started and never looking back! lol)\n",
      "…read more goes on very smooth and dries quickly. i use a couple of swipes over my face and gently rub in! i've noticed a huge difference in my oil production (i'm combo skin, very oily in t-zone) and acne. i've been using it every day/night for two weeks and i love it I love this toner! It takes some getting used to and you must make sure your face is clean, but it’s great! I’ve bought three times now. I was on a search for a new toner and came across this one. I absolutely fell in love with it. Mainly because the application is so easy but it also fells great going on to the skin and I feel like it definitely does its job. I love this product so much. My skin has been amazing since I started using this. I have dry skin and live in a dry climate, and this has really amped up my skincare products. Will definitely be buying again! Switched to this after my face had an allergic reaction to a rose water toner that I had been using for two years. I guess that's how long my body needs for an allergic reaction because my rose soap did the same next! This toner has been the only thing that's worked nicely with all of my products to keep my cystic acne away and not contain my two big allergy ingredients (rose and aloe). It doesn't sting and I follow it up with COSRx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid. If I don't use them together, it doesn't work at all. One without the other? Cystic acne immediately. Really I just got rid of one on my nose because I didn't pay attention. Since acne can depend on a lot of circumstances, spot treat this first and know what your acne is being caused by. If you've got a vague idea, then give this a try and ease yourself into a routine. Stick with it.\n",
      "…read more Love this. Completely changed my skin for the better and i visibly saw a difference within a week of using this product i have bought 4 bottles!!! Refreshing, tightens my pores a little (if only temporarily...sigh). La Neige products seem to be good, smell nice and are priced reasonably. Love this product. It does have a scent. But it makes my face feel so hydrated and fresh feeling. This toner not only smells great but leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. It doesn’t dry out my skin at all. LOVE IT! Repurchased it a bunch of times now and will contribute to do so!!! It’s that great! Love love my toner. I have been using this for 2 years. Very nice product for my oily skin. This really works. I was unsure at first about this product. I I have been using this product for about 4 weeks now and if you have really, really oil skin get a sample of this and try it out. I love origins products including this one. It’s a refreshing ritual for me at the end of the day. I did switch to the Mega-Mushroom which is more expensive and maybe a little better, but this product does the job. This toner has an incredible earthy scent which is not too overpowering. I found that it did a great job without stripping! It reduced the oil on my skin without stripping it. I love this toner. I've tried other ones and they were not good. Just a few drops and you are good to go. You feel very refreshed and renewed. This bottle can last a long time. This is the perfect toner. I absolutely love this toner! I’ve been using Origins for over 5+ years now, and this toner really changed my life. I have combo skin, and this toner does my skin justice year round. Could not recommend this product enough! I've been using this for years on my combination skin and keep coming back to it. It is gentle enough not to strip or sting, but also feels like it's giving me just that little extra bit of cleaning and tightening. I have really problematic, oily, acne-prone skin that can feel pretty gross if I'm not amazing about doing my full skincare routine regularly. This toner is so refreshing and gentle on my sensitive skin, doesn't over-dry, balances me out after cleansing, and has a nice scent. I've repurchased probably 4-5 times!! Definitely recommend if you're looking for just a very neutral, regular, gentle toner in your skincare routine.\n",
      "…read more I have combo/oily skin. In the winter I can get dry around my nose This is my favorite toner. I used to sleep on Origins, but now so much of my skincare routine is products of theirs. This toner is gentle on my sensitive skin (unlike some toners that cause burning/redness) but it also clears up my skin beautifully! I'd recommend this toner to anyone (especially my fellow sensitive skin people). Toner is one of the most underrated products in skincare. This product evened out my skin tone and helped control the oil in my T-zone. I had the best skin ever when using this. I paired it with Origins Checks This is everything! I'm 45, but oily, and this leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh without drying. This product is a must for mature skin. I use it every other day and could see an improvement in the skin texture after the 1st week. really love this I use it once day. I noticed my skin is brighter, less discoloration. I love it my skin feels so clean after my washing it. Amazing! Was sorta skeptical but after using it a few times, I can’t wait to buy some more. Definitely saw a difference after a few times. I did see a slight brightening effect. Holy grail!! Lightens scars and skin looks and feels great! I’ll never be without this! Love this product! I see instant results! The powder to cleanser formula really does preserve the potency. It really works to fade scars and smooth skin. After using this product on my chest and shoulders for 5 weeks I definitely notice freckles and sun spots have lightened. It also help with the mild clogged pools on my clevage. I let it sit for several minutes before using a Clarisonic electric brush, then I let it sit a minute longer. You can split a pack to use 1/2 in the am and the rest at night. It reduced my freckles on my arms and chest! I love this cleanser. I mean, I love powder cleansers in general, but this one is the best I've tried. I love that it's individually packaged. I love that it's gentle and hasn't irritated my skin, but I legitimately noticed my discoloration improving after about a week (even after years of other Vitamin C and AHA/BHA products). I was really skeptical, especially because it doesn't stay on your skin for that long, but MAN it really does work. It might be a little drying for drier skin / winter time, though, and you shouldn't use it on active blemishes (it stings... yeah, I know, I'm a dummy). I have a habit of constantly trying different cleansers, but I think I will stay with this one for a long time. To me, it's totally worth the price.\n",
      "…read more this is the most amazing VIT C product and it does not get enough attention in the beauty world!! Ive tried many high end VIT C products and this one is by far one of my very favorites. My skin looks radiant, clear, fresh and SUPER BRIGHT.

      "…read more amazing. try it you wont be dissappointed. makes my skin super bright and gets rid of lines. works really fast too My mom told me about it. Just like with everything else my mom tells me I was very skeptical, I mean what does she know right? But I decided to give it a try. I bought a 7 day trial pack that had 7 of these packets and a booster serum thing that you mix yourself and it only lasts 7 days, because it is that fresh and goes bad after 7 days. Anyways, the powder cleansing packets won over me almost right away. I noticed my skin feeling and looking slightly more radiant in a couple days. By the end of 7 days I was sold and absolutely hooked. As for the 7 day serum thing, I am not so sure about it. It didn't impress me enough to buy more of it. I did end up using it for 9 days. There was product left over and I was not about to throw it out! Use by dates are guidelines, right?... Anyways, my face didn't turn into a pumpkin or anything, but I also didn't come out of my 7 days with the serum looking like Gigi Hadid. People tell me I have high expectations. I am now back buying the second supply of these powder cleansers. I use it only in the morning. I wet my face and rub the content of one packet in. It lathers really well! I don't wash it off yet, I leave it on while I brush my teeth. Those dreadful two minutes, man... at least it makes me happy thinking that I am getting two things done during that boring time. Then I wash it all off and ta da... I am all fresh and rejuvenated! You can also do what my mother does and use only half of the packet and save the other half for the next day. She swears by it. Who knows, she could be right there as well...\n",

Great for sensitive skin. Cleans well! No redness or itching after use. Best micellar water I've used so far. Doesn't leave any residue or film. Smells nice. Doesn't irritate my eyes. Leaves skin soft and smooth, and most of all cleans skin very well. The only issue I have with it is that it testS on animals according to PETA. Love love love this cleanser! No residue and it doesn’t irritate my eyes at all This is one of my holy grail products. I started incorporating micellar water into my routine, just one I bought from the drugstore, but after reading up on some of the ingredients I wanted to switch to a cleaner product. I tried Caudalie, I love a lot of their products but it left my skin with a weird tacky residue...I returned and tried this and it’s amazing! No residue, just give a minute to fully dry before doing the next step in your routine. It does an excellent job cleansing, I often use it on it’s own instead of double cleansing, and I have oily skin!! And it fully cleans my skin, not as great for removing a full face of makeup- not because it doesn’t do the job, but you need several cotton pads to get everything off, and it’s a little pricey for the amount you get so I only use for light makeup days.\n",
      "…read more Originally when I bought this I thought my face was breaking out, but after just three days it all went away and took all my redness away with it! I like to use it in the morning only to take away all the oil I’ve gotten overnight and it’s the perfect light cleanser in the morning. It isn’t make away too much moister and perfectly sets me up for my make up routine after!! This is a GREAT micellar cleanser!! I have very dry/sensitive skin...and this works without drying out my skin (like other micellar waters) I like the smell too. I use this after I wash my face at night to make sure I get all eye and makeup off. Then I use it in the morning before applying makeup/lotion (to save time instead of washing my face) TIP: I do use the Shiseido facial cotton pads. It doesn't take as much of the product as regular cotton pads. You get about 160 pads for $12 on Sephora. Money well spent. And these pads also don't leave cotton hairs all over your face!! The whole Mega-Mushroom line is great for dry/sensitive/red skin. I highly recommend.\n",

I wish it was a little cheaper because I have gone through 4 bottles but with how much my skin loves it! it’s worth it ❤️ I have very sensitive/oily skin and this product has worked wonders. Any redness will immediately subside once I have applied this and it smells so, so good!! I saw a review on this and was intrigued. I must say, it's actually worth the hype. I usually use a cream to remove my makeup and it visibly does a great job. Then I run a little bit of this after and OMG, the amount of makeup it removes is insane. Even on days when I don't put makeup and just put sunscreen, by the end of the day, when I wipe my face with this and oh la la does a lot of stuff come out.

It made my skin feel super soft and removed more makeup that was left in my skin even after I already washed my face. I use this product morning and night and I will never go back to anything else! Seriously amazing. Smells lovely, super refreshing, keeps me dewy all day I am on my second bottle. I absolutely love this product. The smell is amazing. I’ve tried so many face mists and toners. I wanted something that I could feel working on my skin but something that also hydrated it. This is it! I love the scent, I love the amount of product, and most importantly I love how it makes my skin feel. I use this everyday, multiple times per day. It's my absolute favorite toner ever. The best smelling spray toner ever! Makes me happy to spray all times during the day! My favorite toner! The smell is amazing! And I love the mister. Hydrating and refreshing. This toner is beautiful as a skin care step but is also great over top of makeup (super fine mist!). Love that this product is vegan and cruelty-free. This is a lovely toner. I love that it is a spray. The nozzle is a little funky on mine, so I don't get a clean mist (there is like one spot on my face that gets blasted). Honestly that's fine though. I don't know if all the bottles are like that. But I always start my night-time skincare routine with this, so in my mind who cares if I get a little more on my face? It does smell like coconuts and roses and it's very soft smelling. I don't think I will repurchase just because I discovered the Thayers Facial Toner in Rose which I adore and it's a bit cheaper. Although this is very fairly priced in my opinion. If you're interested, I'd say try it out.\n",

It was a super recommendation from Astrid, an Algenist brand rep. Most cleansers I’ve used have felt very stripping and my skin felt so dry afterward. This cleanser is the exact opposite.

I received this as a sample and have been using for a week now and notice a HUGE difference in my skin tone, feel, and overall appearance. It's simply wonderful. I highly recommend. I was totally skeptical about this product. I’m 31 years old. This Product really helps to plump and fill in my fine lines.

It makes my skin feels smooth and matte. I had tiny lines under my eyes, and just using this for a few days.. It seems to improve them. I am trying to wait a while before I go get my filler for a little of my eye hollowing, and this seems to be helping a lot. This serum is so good. It’s Hydrating, makes my skin feel so soft, it’s not oily or liquidy like most serums, it’s a bit thicker, so it stays where you put it on your skin, no need to rub it all around, it absorbs readily. Worth the money, and lasted me a long time. The term \"holy grail\" is often overused - and this is the only time I have used it to describe a product. I discovered this serum 6 years ago and found myself going back to it time after time. Nothing else has measured up, so I have been using it exclusively for 3 years. Fine lines are definitely diminished, and my skin feels smooth. This wears very well under primer or makeup, but it also gives your skin a smooth look on its own. This is worth the splurge, sis.\n",

That said, 2nd huge bonus is that it makes your skin feel like silk after applying it. Sooooo smooth. Makeup goes on like a dream and it does not make me oily! I love this stuff. Besides the price I can say that it has one more negative, it takes a lot t cover my whole face. This little jar only lasted me a month and most serums that size last me 4-6. I can’t take off a star because the product is so amazing.\n",

She’s 55 and is beginning to get concerned about her facial contours (wrinkles to her, marks of happiness to me!). So she religiously used this all up in a time span of about 3 months every single day. Not only did she feel way more confident but she told me her friends even mentioned to her that she looks more youthful. Sounds pretty good to me!\n",

I have very very sensitive acne prone skin and have always struggled to find something to reduce my redness and spots without giving me a rash, and this product does that! I only use it 2-3 times a week but has made a huge difference in my skin and the results were pretty quick. I would definitely recommend this product, worth the price I love that this is real retinol and not a retinoid sub. A lot of the the retinoids are gentler, but less effective, at a given percentage. This has helped knock back hormonal acne and has faded some age spots, and softened/REMOVED wrinkles. No, it doesn’t smell pretty, but I prefer that to irritating added coverup fragrances. I do have to dry my hands before using the bottle, but you’re not supposed to apply retinol with wet hands, so it’s not much of an issue for me. I’ve had no issues with the bottle/pump breaking, and it keeps the product fresh. I have dry skin, and I actually like the formulation. Yes, it’s thick and rich, but I need the moisture, and it doesn’t pill under my SPF lotion or with any of my other oils and creams. I’m not a huge foundation wearer, but no trouble with that either (I use NARS long wear). I will keep repurchasing this.\n",

The lower concentration worked well for every other day to start, and now I've built up to daily. The twist top is a bit strange, but I will definitely purchase again. Great retinol product from FAB! Best retinol I have ever used. I have tried many things to combat my face getting red and puffy at the end of the day, and was recommended to use retinol to try and work it out, and it just surprised me that after one use my skin was able to hold out the entire day and I didn't look like I had been running around all day. Would definitely recommend for retinol first users and even though the price tag is a bit out there, it is the best retinol I have found so far. I plan on using it thrice a week and hope it will not dry me out as much, but we'll see.\n",

My face has never felt this soft before, nor have I had so many compliments on how my skin looks. I currently use it 3 times a week and will gradually increase. The one week of dry sensitive skin was so worth the results.\n",

I had a lot of acne scars and dark spots but this retinol has changed my life. Excellent, gentle retinol. I've just increased to nightly usage and have been noticing happier, healthier skin without any of the downsides of retinol products. I'll definitely purchase again. I have extra sensitive skin and am prone to eczema and milia. I had to start using this once every 3 days, but now am using it daily each night. I love this product because it smooths out my skin even through the occasional eczema flare ups and my acne breakouts have become very minimal. I do find that I need to use a thicker night time moisturizer when using this product and need to put on sunscreen the following morning. I learned the hard way when I first started but once you get the peeling and sunburn one day, I never forget sunscreen now (a blessing in disguise for forcing me into a better skincare routine!) This retinol serum is a great starter for people just getting into using retinols and especially for someone with extra sensitive skin like myself.\n",

I put some on my boyfriend’s face and the results weren’t so instant; perhaps I saw a difference because I had already had a good skin care routine. This is my third bottle. My skin looks firmer and clearer when I use this serum. It has a lovely scent that is refreshing to apply. I like to use this after my moisturizer as it helps plump my skin. Love this product. I am a skincare nut, and have tried everything! The Genius serum actually gives me noticeable results. I just wish it came in different sizes... it's really expensive! This has really helped with lightening my acne scars without breaking me out. I already looked young for my age but this makes me look even younger. More bushy tailed and bright eyed. It’s great. I don’t even need retinol because this product so much more than a regular vitamin I only paid 19.99 for this product at my local Marshall’s. Very impressed. Been using it for a solid month and will invest in the full price. My only complaint is the smell but I must say I hate fragrance in my skincare. Wow. I started using the Genius line a month ago and i’m in shock. I’m 37 with mostly dry skin (not so bad in the spring/summer, but has flaky dry patches in the fall/winter if i’m not careful). I recently started noticing a few fine lines, a dark area on one cheek and that my makeup didn’t look as great as it used too. My skin care routine prior to this was wash with a drugstore brand cleaner and my Clarisonic and moisturize with French brand $64 moisturizer twice a day. Well, a month ago I started using Algenist melting cleanser, Algenist vitamin C serum, and the Algenist genius white anti-aging cream (as well as a face oil/serum by another company) and my skin has never looked or felt better! The dark spot is fading and so are the fine lines.\n",

This is very expensive but worth it. I don't wear makeup. I follow a 7 step Korean skincare routine. This is essential in my routine. I love SKII! I love it so much, every time I travel I am on the look out for SKII at duty free stores. I recently pair this serum with an serum booster tool, and noticed a significant difference in the density and elasticity of my skin. Highly recommend this product!! Worth the investment! I did get some samples of this for a few months before I broke down and bought it. I dont use it every night, just 3-4 times a week. Helps with dark spots and skin seems firmer. Will buy again I use this with the RNA face cream. Its Amazing!!!! After only 1 use, I noticed that my skin is smoother and brighter. Love how product absorbs really fast in to skin. If you can afford it, buy it. I got a sample and I like it. The price of full size is not very cute, but it's really a good product. Will consider to get one after done my current serum. Ive tried everything from la prairie, la mer, to drugstorr. Nothing compares to how this will change your skin! It is amazing! It leaves your skin so bright, softer than you could ever imagine, and evens out your skin tone and adds a really plumping effect that stays. It is a just have. This will last you a year with use twice a day. Love this so much! Everything breaks me out. I’ve struggled to find products since dr perricone discontinued his skin clear line (please bring it back!). I’m thankful he’s starting to add more oil free options in. Perricone MD High Potency Classics Hyaluronic Intensive Moisturizer is definitely a high quality product. I have used Perricone MD products in the past and have always like the results. I couldn’t wait to use this moisturizer when I received it. I have now been using it for a full month and will be continuing to use it going forward. There are so many harmful pollutants in our environment that wreak havoc on our skin. This adds back moisture to my skin that it desperately craves. I’m using it once in the morning and again before bed. The fine lines on my face are actually gone after one month of faithfully using this product. It’s because my face is actually smoother and therefore diminished the unwelcome creases. The 1oz. jar will last a while because a little bit goes a long way. This is like a drink for your face.

I also have combination skin. This really helped to cut out the dry patches, to alleviate the oil, and to keep my skin balanced. I recommend this to anyone. I received this product for free from Influenster to try for a review. My skin felt hydrated after about 2 uses. My fine lines and wrinkles seemed to light up some. My neck even seemed a little tighter. Great product! Will recommend to my friends and family. Oh my lorddd this is so good. I was a little eh about it because of the price but I put a little on last night, once right when i got home and then again right before bed and it took the scarring down so much I was on FaceTime with my own bf that notices every little thing and he said it looked like it was all gone!!

I have had deep scars for 20 years and nothing has ever helped until now. I highly recommend giving this one a try! With just one purchase my scars are 80% gone. Just purchased again! Love this product. This has been a continuous buy for me and necessary for my skin routine. Only thing I have found to help with current and old scars. I cannot believe how FAST this product works. In the store the woman told me that it would take 4 weeks to fade my red acne scars. I literally saw them start to diminish overnight. It’s been two weeks and some of them are essentially gone. I will never stop using this product. I had serious hormonal acne from my teenage years, all the way into my early 20’s. I’m now in my early 30’s, and left with embarrassing acne scars that I’ve only treated with tea tree oil. I purchased this just to see what would happen. Can’t do any more damage than what’s already been done! Try it! I’ve been using the OleHenriksen power peel twice a week, and follow that up with putting D Scar on my bad spots for about 3 weeks now, and as religiously as possible. My skin has repaired so much that I am literally in complete AWE! This is some of the most smooth, and dent free my face has been in so many years, that it has me completely amazed. I’m in love, and so incredibly thankful for this product. It actually has helped me feel so much better about myself and my appearance. I highly highly HIGHLY recommend giving it a try!

This has so drastically changed my skin that I will never go without it again. Worth every. single. penny. AND it smells AMAZING!! I'm so surprised how well it works. I can't believe I've spent so much time without this product! And it smells so good. I’ll start this review by saying that I bought this serum for preventing wrinkles, not treating them so I can’t speak to the effects on that side. But overall this is my favourite retinol serum I’ve tried. It’s effective and smoothing, I like the texture and the smell.

I have very sensitive skin and I started with this one day a week for a few weeks. Then went up to twice a week. I will continue to do that until the end of the summer then go up to 3 times a week. It has worked very well for me my skin has a much smoother texture and I always make sure to wear sunscreen everyday. I will continue to repurchase this.

My 46 year old skin is brighter, more clear and glowing. Maybe use it less often in the beginning if you are sensitive to it, but I have found this to be the best retinol product I have used. Cant say enough. Literally fixed my tires, acne prone, and scarred skin in just a week! I have literally tried everything out there from $700 creams to $50 ones and this one is the holy grail! As a self-proclaimed skincare “junkie” I have tried it all. Everything from that pachyderm brand, k-beauty, indie brands, and overpriced mega brands. But this, THIS, is the best serum ever. I have NEVER gotten so many compliments on my skin than when I started using this. I’d say about a month in it was glaringly clear that my fine lines had diminished significantly and I looked less droopy. My skin is acne prone and I haven’t noticed any increase in that area so thank goodness. In my late 30’s it’s nice to hear from people that they thought I was in my 20’s!

I have been an Origins customer for over 20 years, changing to different products within the brand as my skin required more moisture.

Once I ran out I went a few weeks and noticed my deep lines and dull skin were back so I purchased the serum and within 4 days it was back to being tight, glowy, and youthful. I’m so impressed that a plant based serum can do this! I overhauled my skincare routine to be mostly Amore Pacific products when I was battling some cystic acne and hyperpigmentation scars from that acne. I love this stuff. Since using it my skin has stopped going from extreme dry to oily and back again throughout the day. My hyperpigmentation has pretty much faded (I’m sure that also is due to just time passing!) and overall my skin just looks good. I visited a new dermatologist a few weeks after starting this regimen and she said that whatever I was using I should keep using it because my skin was bright and in good shape. Hallelujah. The price is insane BUT one pump works for my whole face and the bottle dispenses a small amount so I’m never over-using. Worth the investment for me. Love the smell too.\n",

One of the best, most softening, soothing things I've found for my skin! The description hypes up the antioxidants, but for me it is the plant polysaccharides in this formula that make it such a winner. The bamboo sap and whatever else that makes it feel all silky like that. I have found few other products out there that incorporate good quality polysaccharide-rich ingredients and it's a shame. I can just feel how soft and slippery it is as soon as I put it in my hand and when it has absorbed all the way, there is no sticky or oily residue - my skin just feels SOFT and hydrated. It doesn't feel heavy and sticky. I usually put it on under moisturizer or sometimes I use it as a ligh weight moisturizer on top of another serum that is a little heavier. I had a big sample of this before I bought it. I wish they made a smaller size of this so I could carry one in my purse. Seems there is nowhere near enough alcohol in this product to dry out skin. I think the alcohol is probably what makes it easy to spread it in such a thin layer, but when it evaporates, I'm still left with this awesome layer of moisture on my skin, sooo... The alcohol doesn't bother me at all.\n",

I don't like fragrances added to skin care products, this product has a lovely delicate odor that completely matches it's silky feel on the skin. No residue of any kind. I use it am and PM in my routine. I think serums are high- priced in general, this is not as expensive as some I've tried. Love this product! I am 32 and my face is so sensitive and acne prone I was not using any serums because all the ones I had tried previously made me break out. I got a recommendation to try this serum and I'm glad I did. It has not broken me out and leaves my skin feeling silky and soft (along with my normal moisturizer). Thank you AMORE for making something for extremely delicate skin like mine! Love, love, love! Best Rejuvenating serum, helps with break outs, hydrates and brightens your skin, and smells Amazing! It also less forever My skin is very dry and this works fantastically to hydrate and plump it up. I can go makeup free after I started using this. I was constantly on the lookout for reliable moisturising serum as I have dry and sensitive skin. I got this product in full size and this is now officially my new favourite (the old fav was Decorte Moisture Liposome Serum). It does exactly what it describes and the bonus is it's extremely calming. The great smell just makes me want to use it any chance I've got. Will definitely purchase again! Expensive-yes. Amazing-absolutely!! I’ve tried a lot of Sephora’s serums and only Amorepacific makes a difference on my skin I used to use the moisture bound as well but thought I’d see if it was the serum that was making the difference so I tried a different moisturizer brand. It’s the serum that makes the difference! I’m hooked I hated all moisturizers - until now this entire line is pricey. But worth it. My esthetician recommended this line and I have not looked back since. Get the whole line . Once I tried this serum, it's hard to use anything else. I used this serum for over 2 years now. This serum is super hydrating and a little goes a long way. Although the price point is on the higher side, it lasts you for months. It uses bamboo leaf extract instead of water, so it soaks into the skin and doesn't evaporate. improved complexion and gives radiance The serums I was using before I switched to this serum were generally $300 . I thought that La Prairie was the end all be all, and I didn’t expect much when trying this. Wow, was I pleasantly surprised! I have combination skin which includes an oily chin and nose areas, with dryer cheeks and normal forehead. This serum works for my entire face! I’d grown accustomed to not applying products to my combination/acne-prone areas, so being able to use a product that actually works while not breaking me out is fantastic. My dry areas are no longer dry, and the rest of my skin is hydrated without being oily. My first bottle has lasted me two months of thus far, already justifying the very fair price. Thinking back to when I used to spend anywhere from $300-$700 on serums makes me cringe! My skin has never looked better since I started using this product, and I hope they never stop making it. It glides easily over my skin and spreads nicely. Two pumps is enough to cover both my face and neck. Like all AMOREPACIFIC products, the scent is light and fresh. I truly can’t say enough positive things about this incredible serum.\n",

It's very hydrating, has improved my breakouts and texture majorly. The only downside is that this product is crazy expensive. I have gone through the entire bottle and will be purchasing another. I absolute love this texture on my skin. Not only does it make my makeup better in the day time but my skin is even brighter. I just love how amazing my skin feels and redness goes down on my skin.

I use this nightly, sometimes during the day if i need it. But i have noticed (along with the other products in this line) help keep my skin supple and smooth. I suggest if you use this use it with a second prodict in this line or with the renewal line. I’m a 32 year old women who suffers from hormonal/cystic acne. I decided to give this a try and it has worked really well for me. When I stared to use this I had very painful under the skin pimples and I was miserable.

It fights acne and my signs of aging have gotten better too. Will definitely repurchase and recommend. I've been using this in the morning after I wash my face and although I haven't been using it long enough to see any real effects yet, it feels really nice on my skin and does not leave me feeling greasy or overly dry. Product performed as expected. Knocked out some stubborn acne I was experiencing and I noticed visible improvement to wrinkles. While pricey, a little goes a long way. I've been using this product and its predecessor for 5 years and routinely get told I look 5 years younger than I am. Additionally, I worked outside in the desert and mountains for years so should arguably look like beef jerky. This stuff good sunscreen=MAGIC! amazing product.

My skin looks so clear and a huge reduction in forhead lines, LOVE LOVE LOVE I love this from first use. It helps my skin a lot. No new breakouts. Looks like this product stop the proces of breakouts in the beginning. Very light, absorbs very fast. LOVE IT. Love this, seems to really be keeping the hormonal acne at bay! Ever since getting my IUD my skin has been TERRIBLE with hormonal acne/redness/sensitivity/etc. I've tried so many different skin care routines and even expensive dermatologist creams. Nothing worked and I end up with irritated redness and peeling on top of acne like I was back in my teens. As a professional in her 30s this is beyond frustrating. Tried this at MIL urging--best decision ever. My skin has improved substantially and is almost back to its pre-IUD level. Acne has cleared almost completely. If I'm getting a little bump its shrunk if not completely cleared by morning. I've seen an overwhelming reduction of breakouts with constant use. I also love that this fights wrinkles too. Battling acne and fine lines and wrinkles at the same time has posed a problem with layering creams that counteract each other. This stuff does a wonderful job at both!! My forehead looks much smoother. This stuff is now an indispensable part of my daily routine.\n",

I went from using them every day to now every other day to control any blemishes. Absolutely love them. This is absolutely a must for acne prone skin. I have very sensitive, combination-dry skin. This helps with my acne without drying my skin or irritating it. I also like to use this because it helps me see if my cleansing didn't get all of my makeup. This is an absolute staple in my skincare routine. I also love that it's got the clean at Sephora mark. Highly recommend.

I have normal skin and being in my late 30s, I get that 1-2 pesky breakout every month (used Kate Somerville's Eradi-Kate, works beautifully).

Very satisfied with these acne pads I will purchase again. I LOVE these. I use it like a toner in the morning. They're not drying These pads have drastically changed my skin texture. After one week, using 2x day my skin is smoother, cleaner, brighter. I have used every product under the sun, prescription, medical grade, cheap, expensive; and nothing has done for skin what these have in such a short amount of time.

I was having bad travel acne from flying and picked these up. Not only did my acne and redness go down, it didn’t dry my skin out or make it irritated (I have very sensitive skin.) I would recommend these to anyone. I haven’t used clearing pads in over 10 years so I was skeptical of picking these up. I am 100% satisfied with how these have helped my skin. When I experience hormonal breakouts, these pads help minimize my breakouts and restore my skin's texture without overdrying my skin. Got it for my son. It cleaned up his acne fast Cut the pads in half and I strongly recommend only using every other day. These pads are strong enough to have a noticeable effect but they have enough soothing ingredients that help with irritation and actually heal your skin. I’ve always struggled to find a salicylic product that would work but didn’t burn my skin, but these are wonderful! They have helped with acne, congested pores, tone, and my skin is definitely smoother.\n",
      "…read more Amazing product. I’ve started using it in place of my nightly moisturizer and the results have been great. Plumped younger looking skin I haven’t had in 10+ years. Leave on overnight. Worth the $ I love REN. This product has a fresh peaches smell, doesn't ruin your thread count at night, and makes for a plump face in the morning. Gentle and effective this is a great retinol product for sensitive faces. <3 This product is amazing! I’ve tried using the kiehls midnight recovery oil before and a couple of other night oils but this is probably the best. I have a oily-combination acne prone skin but this stuff is amazing. It’s very comfortable to the skin and you can tell that this oil actually penetrates in your skin and leave your skin with bright dewy glow the next day. It’s weird coz you know its oil that you’re putting on your face but it doesn’t feel oily or greasy. I usually just use about 3-5 drops. A little goes a long way on this one. I always use this whenever I have hormonal breakouts and it helps to reduce the redness and scarring after. I always keep it simple whenever my skin is acting out. Just proper cleansing, my hydrating serum then this oil and it does work wonders on my skin. Amazing amazing stuff. Highly recommend.\n",

Within 3 months of consistently use of Ren Bio Retinoid and Beautiful Firm Shot serum, my skin is at its best that I haven't seen for years! Reduced my ance scars, plump my skin, my pore getting a lot smaller, always glowing! This is my 3rd bottle and Im telling you. You should really give this product a try. And if you do, try it with Beautiful Firm Shot, it will change your skin for the better!\n",
      "…read more Been using this product since I bought it during the sale, and I’ve got to say, in combination with my other products it has been an amazing addition to my growing skincare routine! I can visibly see a difference in my skin, specifically the texture and pores have decreased significantly! I have (mostly) dry, combination skin if that helps anyone and only use it during the night. This delivers all of the benefits of retinol with no irritation, burning, or sensitivity issues. Highly recommend all Ren's products - this is my nightly serum. This oil seriously needs to go viral! It's so good. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. The rose scent smells great and is very light. I use it at night and wake up with radiant, glowy skin. SO happy! The first retinol that I have used that does not leave my skin feeling like a lizard afterwards! In a few weeks' time I've gone from twice a week to every night. This is gentle and effective. My skin has had increasingly reduced redness since incorporating into my routine. Follow this with a nice thick layer of moisturizer! I have been using it for a little over a week and my skin feels amazing. My boyfriend actually noticed that my skin was visibly more smooth. Smells great! I have just purchased this product, Have used it 4 times so far twice a day. I bought this based on the review . My skin is far from perfect, I have hormonal acne and uneven skin tone . This is my first time using a Vitamin c serum. I love this one so far, it smells good, doesn't feel sticky and is absorbed in the skin immediately. I feel my face is getting smoother and softer. Will continue to use and update my review.\n",

I have sensitive oily skin that gets red rashes and breaks out on every product, but omg this is the first c product that I can apply all over my face with no red rashes or itch !! thank you I usually use daily in the morning, follow with sunscreen. it absorbs really fast，my acne spot actually got better，the smell is also really good，love it，definitely recommend！ I love this vitamin C serum , my skin is so smooth and look brightener. This is my favorite. Love it Loooooove this. It soften and brighten my skin without zit. This product works wonders. It brightens and plumps the skin without leaving a greasy residue. This is my First. Time. Ever. writing a review of any product. I'm brown combo/oily acne prone skin. My issues include active acne, acne scars, hyperpigmentation. I have used this product for about almost a month now and TODAY I can see significant results. My scars have faded, It did not make me break out (which is my MAIN concern when trying out a new product) in fact my skin has stopped breaking out. NOTICE: that it took me about a month to see results. There was a time when I almost gave up on it and wanted to discontinue using it. I learned my lesson. I must always give the new product some time (unless my skin reacts to the product) I absolutely love it!!! and highly recommend it. It has a ginger-ish smell to it. I see some people are very sensitive to smell but if a product is showing me results, I don't mind it at all. Will definitely purchase again. Oh and it definitely clears your overall complexion!\n",

Not only did it fade my sun damaged chest and neck area but it faded age spots. Loved this product and have gone thru it all. So happy with this. When I opened the product, the first thing I noticed was it’s lovely orange scent. What an energizing bit of aromatherapy for my face :) ! The serum was also very light and it felt weightless on my face, I have to say, My skin does look better. I had quite a bit of unevenness to my skin-tone and I experienced a notable improvement. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review, and I will buy a bottle happily when I run out, especially going into winter when skin needs extra care.\n",
      "…read more Absolutely loved this product and noticed a difference within a few days of using it. This is amazing. I use it day and night. Its non greasy and a little goes a long way. It has lightened my dark circles and reduced my fine lines. This serum is fantastic! It does great work at brightening a dull complexion, as the product’s name suggests, and does so without creating a reactivity on my skin. It did tingle a little when initially applied, but that faded away after a few days. I’ve used other pricey vitamin C serums in the past that didn’t give me a healthy glow like this serum does, and I am now a true fan of this product. I received this product as a free sample to try, but will purchase this soon—it’s that good and worth every penny of its price.\n",

When I was around 48 my chest began to show the sun damage, the skin was red and with some wrinkles. I bought this serum for my face, to try something new, but normally I extend the products I use on my face to my neck and chest. Two weeks after the first use the redness disappeared and the wrinkles too. I have never stopped using it and normally I received compliments about the skin in that area.\n",
      "…read more This really works! I couldn't not believe the difference I noticed in my skin tone and texture. It really does boost the effects of your regular moisturizer! It took a week before I saw the benefits, but then I was amazed. This serum makes my skin look smoother and wrinkles disappear. After trying many, this is the only one that has worked. I highly recommend it. I have used this off and on for years. Every time I stop I can tell a difference. I am writing this as I am on my way to the store to buy another bottle after not having one for about 8 months and starting to be plagued with uneven skintone. This is the one product in my skincare routine that has me confident enough to not have to wear foundation. To any skeptic, just go ahead and try it. It is money well spent. This is the most reliable product I have ever used. You might break out at first as it pulls toxins out of your skin, especially if you pair it with a chemical exfoliant. It really makes a huge difference to the texture of your skin. Even during the purging phase, you skin will be noticeably softer. I stopped using it at one point because the value size isn't available anymore and it's expensive. I wondered why my skin felt rougher and nothing I used made a significant difference. I realized that this serum is the keystone. Within six weeks my skin is back to baby soft. I will be using this consistently and without interruption going forward.\n",
      "…read more I'm incredibly skeptical of products that claim to be detoxifying and don't have ingredients that are backed by hard science. That said, I picked this version of the serum up after using the previous version years ago and within 3 days a number of my gripes with my skin cleared up. My skin feels firmer and the red spots that had been showing up on my cheeks on and off are gone. It works well with other products too. This is the only Dior product in my routine but it is making all the difference.\n",

After using this serum for 2weeks My skin is now a lot more glowy and alive . Thanks to the sephora adviser for making me try this. Yes it’s very expensive but you really dont need a lot (1-2 pump). The 1oz. Bottle will last a few months for sure. I’m still shocked I’ve finally found a product that is a game changer for my skin. I’m mid 40s, have had some fine lines, enlarged pores, occasional hormonal cystic acne & red/blotchiness areas on my face. This product has dramatically changed my skin. I’ve had NO breakouts, my skin is more even toned, smooth & pores are much less noticeable. Been using for about 8weeks now & will never stop. It is the first step in my routine (after cleansing), I spray on a toner & apply one pump of 1E to my face then apply serums & moisturizer/sunscreen.\n",
      "…read more This stuff is an amazing booster to your skincare routine. I suffer from acne prone skin and I have noticed a large difference, my pores and skin texture have improved drastically. The medium size bottles while pricy lasts 10 months. Highly recommed this product. I never really had any expectation for Dior skincare but after I start using this, I never got any pimples or breakout anymore, I can’t stop, i use it morning and night as a serum, I feel like it’s enough, it’s not heavy at all, it’s light but hydrate enough, I love it hope everyone can try it too. Worth every penny!! After two week of use, my skin had less redness and people thought I was pregnant because of the amazing glow this product gives. You will not be disappointed. This does boost my skin care regime. I have bought the one ounce but I should have bought the biggest size. I love this stuff. Yes it’s expensive but I’d rather spend more money on skincare than makeup. I’m in love with this product. I have oily but very sensitive skin, prone to breakouts. But not with this, it is absorbing very fast, it doesn’t make my skin oily ( I use it with Dream Skin Advance ) even after all day with makeup. Would definitely recommend this. I use it both day and night. It absorbs quickly which is good for my oily skin. Another great Dior skincare! This product has helped to diminish dark spots. My skin looks beautiful now. Clearer and also looks hydrated and healthy. Pores? What are those? I absolutely love this serum. It is so lightweight and perfectly preps the skin! I would not recommend this as a night serum. I would use it during your morning routine to see the best results. When used with a proper cleansing routine and skincare routine, I did see a difference in the visibility of my pores. However, you can’t expect one product to do the work of 5. Perfect additive to a solid routine!\n",

I did not receive this as a promotion or sample it before - I just wanted to try it as I've been on a long search for a product that does what this does for me and will definitely be repurchasing!\n",

This product leaves my skin feeling super soft and looking even. This is my go to serum day and night. I’ve repurchased it so many times. Totally worth it I have been using this product regularly and totally love the texture of the serum. I love how it reduces the appearance of open pores on my skin and makes it appear smooth. applying it twice a day is a must. The most effective Pore Minimizing serum EVER ! It is soft, with rich aroma and leaves the skin silky I love this product. I've been using it off and on for 10 years. When I use it with the Double Wear Foundation, I get lots of compliments. It definitely does its job. Softens, hides the pores, make up goes on so smooth and flawless. I really love this serum, I’m on my 4th or 5th jar (a jar lasts me 8 months or so). I notice that my skin is a lot brighter and smoother when I’m using it. It just looks flowy and healthy. It’s very hydrating, but it doesn’t make me break out. Doesn’t feel greasy like their collagen pressed serum does. Wish it wasnt so expensive, but I like it enough to keep using it I used this for over a year and the slight lines I had in my forehead did diminish in appearance. I thought it may be a fluke so I change to something else for a while and I noticed a difference. While this won’t remove wrinkles completely (lets be honest only Botox can do that) it does help with smoothing things out. It’s also very luxurious feeling, it melts into your skin and makes it feel super soft. I also like that the smell is not super strong.\n",

Forehead wrinkles have all but disappeared, and the little frown line between my eyes is far less noticeable, as are smile lines. I also use this line's day cream and I think the two together are perfect for my skin. I've also noticed the texture of my skin is finer and firmer. I have oily, sensitive skin that can breakout when I use the wrong products, and this line causes no problems at all.\n",

I’m oily skin and I love slathering this as night on my neck and face! Absorbs quickly smells like coconuts and literally melts away. Skin feels fresh, hydrated, and supple. I would have this as a staple in my routine ! I love this stuff. This came as part of the Sephora Favorites Beauty Sleep set and it's one of my favorites. I use it on the off nights when I don't use a retinol, and when I wake up my skin is even, glowy and seems to be less red than it usually is. I have oily skin and this product doesn't feel heavy at all. I'm also prone to breakouts and this has given me zero issues. I ADORE this serum. I'm a massive skincare girl and I've tried literally everything - although there are many great products out there, none have changed my skin the way this has. I received it as a sample about four months ago - in one night, this product made my skin more smooth and even than ever before. It took me about two months to go through the tiny sample size with nightly use (a little goes a long way), and I was so happily surprised to see how massive the full size is!! It is expensive, but definitely getting the bang for your buck. I can't imagine ever stopping use of this serum - it got me through a late winter, humid spring, and the beginning of a very dry summer. I'm enamored, and would recommend to anyone looking to smooth and brighten their skin.\n",

I can’t speak for wrinkles because even at 31 I still don’t have any but I trust it’s doing it’s job to kee them away. I will DEFINITELY be buying the full size cause I can’t live without this now. Bummer cause it’s not cheap hahah Life changing! I was breaking out from the glow recipe watermelon overnight mask and this is clearing everything up. My skin is starting to look normal again! This stuff is magic. So to start, it smells and feels so amazing. It just melts right into my skin. I know they say 10 days to see a difference, but honestly, I saw a difference after the first use. It just smooths your skin out, I don't know a better way to put it. I am obsessed with this stuff. Love this product! My skin was plumper and small wrinkles were less visible after just the first night. Also the serum smells amazing. Definitely worth the price. excellent product; i have utilized for a couple years now I got this product for a birthday gift. I can't stop talking about this product. I love the product. I can definitely see results in a couple days. It's gentle on the skin. My skin starts to look a lot healthier. I would recommend this product. This is such an underrated product! I've tried other overpriced vitamin C products and concluded that this is the best bang for my buck. This stuff works. I know it works because I know how my skin reacts to vitamin C (redness and stinging). My skin is too sensitive to use this everyday but I mix half a scoop with my Vitamin C serum every other night and I apply it to my face. My skin looks brighter and more even the next morning. This stuff is amazing but use it sparingly if you have sensitive skin. I haven’t even had this for a week and dark spots have drastically lightened. I’m so amazed I added this into my daily skincare regimen and I am so glad I did. I’ve been using it religiously for five months, on my second bottle, and my GOODNESS what a difference. My dark spots have practically disappeared, my skin tone is much more even with a bit of a glow. I’ve gotten compliments on how great my skin looks. I’m never going to stop using this. But! I do wish they worked on the packaging....maybe attach the little spoon/scooper to the lid? The spoon has def slipped out of my hand once or twice. Overall, great product. I’m a fan!\n",

Considering that I’m a teacher, that’s impressive. this powder is a great way to keep Vitamin C stable; I mix with a clear non greasy serum and use under make up. This brand has been around for a long time and for good reason. Me, I honestly never cared to try any of the products and I honestly dn why until recently. It was always there but I feel like it’s just one that nobody ever really talks about, but as you notice they always have the best reviews so that should speak for itself. Oddly enough, somehow my whole skincare routine has now ended up philosophy. It all started with renewed hope in a jar that I bought simply because it was a good deal(facewash, clay mask, and spf moisturizer) and I absolutely fell in love with how well it worked. I pair this with the renewed hope in a jar every morning and I use the help me retinol at night. I honestly have never felt more confident in my ski even though I am now 33 and had hyperpigmentation from pregnancy and sun damage from years of tanning. I also had very dehydrated skin. I keep wanting to buy all these other “hyped up” products that others rave about but never end up giving me any real results but can only somehow take the leap with these. I’m so tired of buying and returning products or wasting money on things that were the new “hype” and I’m glad I stumbled upon this.. This line has truly given me the results I been praying for.\n",

( I have oily t zone) my face is oil free and glowing like a star. This powder is much much better than any vitamin c skin care product I have tried before.

I used it for about 3 weeks,since I got the mini size, and I’ve had these dark spots on the sides of my face FOREVER that always looked like super bad bronzer !! And the spots were completely gone !!! I absolutely love this and the smell is amazing. Only prob is that I’m all about clean beauty now and this isn’t clean so I’ve stopped using it:( but even to this day, almost a year later those spots are still lighter then they have ever been, they’re very very very faint then before so it truly did it’s job.

After a week of using this product, twice a day, I’ve noticed a difference in my skins natural appearance. This serum will give your face a natural highlight glow, especially during the summer days. Treat yourself! Received so many complements on my skin after only a few days of using this product. Had previously used the drunk elephant vitamin C serum, this is so much better!! A staple in my skincare routine. Seriously the best serum I've ever used. I've been using this for about a month now, and while my skin definitely went through a \"purging\" stage for about two weeks, the breakouts have mostly subsided and I am noticing my skin looking much brighter and healthier. Dark spots from acne scars have begun fading away, which was something I didn't think could actually happen. A little goes a long way with this stuff - I bought a travel size just to try and even after using every day for a month I still have about 1/3 remaining - and I find that it applies best immediately after washing the face. My skin absorbs it pretty quickly too, and it smells wonderful. I will definitely be purchasing a large bottle after this mini finally runs out.\n",

I cannot believe how much this brightens my face and helps keep it clearer. I struggle a lot with acne but have found that a chemical exfoliate really makes a difference and this is the best of the best. I use this a few times per week and then use the Sephora peeling pads in between uses to save a little $. Love the results! So for reference, I have very pale, sensitive, red, splotchy skin. I have large pores and break out a lot. I recently starting following the K beauty 10 step routine and included these 2-3x a week in place of an exfoliant. Since I use a bunch of things on my face, it’s hard to credit the improvement to just one product BUT I’ve been using the extra moisture from these pads on my décolletage area (and nothing else) and I couldn’t believe the difference!

I've noticed a big difference in less than a week! I don’t normally buy products twice unless I really love them . This is one amazing product I’ve watched my skin transform before my eyes ! This is it. My holy grail of skincare. I have had some terrible cystic acne for the last six months that I chalked up to my skin changing as I got older (yippee). I tried adding in a retinoid product (the DE one) which helped some, but not until I went through a horrible skin ‘purge’ where I was left covered in acne scars and still had some painful spots. And after using this product every other day for the last month, there is a bright light at the end of the tunnel.

It has noticeably improved the texture of my skin. I have a sensitive neck and chest, so can only use this product on my face. Before I started using tretinoin, I used this product at night along with a Dr. Dennis Gross Retinol product. The texture and appearance of my skin improved dramatically.

Really happy with all the products I’ve used in this line! My friend with acne scars swore by this and said this how she got rid of her pigmentation. I bit the bullet and paid $88 for the 35 treatments. It’s only been a week but I have seen major improvements. I can’t say it’s 100% this product because I have also made lifestyle changes (eating healthy and drinking water) and added thing to my routine such as gentle face wash, hydrating toner and water based hydrating face lotions. My pores are a bit smaller and my skin is less red and irritated. The texture of my skin has changed for the better and my makeup goes on better. I use these every night but I noticed it was starting to burn a bit too much on my t-zone. So I cut the pads in half and some nights just apply it to my scars avoiding my T-zone.

Ufffff is really good change completely the way that my skin look is awesome 100% recommend I have sensitive skin and I’ve found over the years that sticking to basics tends to work best. I heard about Sunday Riley Good Genes in my late 20s when my skin was all over the place, and I have used it every day since I got my first sample. It’s seriously a miracle product; I genuinely look 5 years younger. I’ve had smile lines since I was a kid, and this erases them. I don’t get breakouts anymore and my skin usually looks flawless.

      "…read more This is one of those staples in my daily skincare routine. If I run out I see the difference in my skin tone. I literally glow after using this. Blemish free. Love this product. I have very dry and sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin at all. After one use I immediately noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. My skin felt so much smoother. I only use this product at night because I use a Vitamin C serum (Ole Henriksen Truth Serum) in the morning and I don’t want to risk destabilizing my Vitamin C. This product is amazing. I started off using it only at night but now I use it in the AM as well. My skin is so clear, soft and supple as a result and I love the smell. I generally wouldn't spend this much on a treatment but I received a sample in my Allure Beauty Box and it changed my skin overnight so I had to get it. I love exfoliating. My skin was a pink sensitive mess. My aesthetician said to cut it out and try an acid. Chose this one and I feel like my skin is transformed!, I use it every night. It’s creamier than a lot of serum type products. Goes on smooth. I follow it up a few hours later with a night cream or oil. Love it. I have less redness, smoother skin, and even get skin compliments from coworkers. I’m very happy and will continue to use. FYI it took a week plus to see major improvements but it did seem like my skin looked more even toned in the morning within days of use\n",
      "…read more These are literally amazing. You put on the zit, it pulls out the gross stuff, and it’s gone. I’m such a bad compulsive scratcher so this helps me sooooo much! These things definitely work! They work best on acne that’s already been popped (even though you’re not supposed to, we all do it), and they still work amazing on pimples under the surface! Whether they’re just starting to form, they’re ready to blow, or they’ve been red blemishes on your face for a while, these dots clear acne up crazy fast. Absolutely love these! I always get hormonal acne and I put one these dots on after I wash my face and it’s calmed down so much or completely gone! They would be super easy for teens and younger kids to use too because it’s literally just a sticker on the face and it’s super gentle. I even put them on my occasional chest spot too and leave in on all day and it’s gone after I take it off. I love these things I always have them in my travel bags and in the bathroom and some at my moms house when I go there for a weekend and a back up pack because they’re so cheap and so easy to use I’m always super happy I have them on hand!\n",
      "…read more Seriously amazing, these are the real deal, so easy to use, and yes. A sticker really CAN get rid of my cystic breakouts. I’m in LOVE. I’m inpatient, so I prefer to use benzoyl peroxide and BHA for treating a red and closed breakout. I only use this patch when the breakout ruptures (or when I pop it). I make sure all the gunk is out, clean the area with some antiseptic and then put this patch on. It prevents the open wound from developing a dark and hard crust, which takes more than a week to come off. It also calms down any residual Inflammation overnight. When I take it off in the morning, the redness and swelling are usually gone or very minimal, and I can cover up the area with concealer smoothly, without the texture making it more prominent. Overall, it makes the healing process much faster. Combined with regular exfoliation and azaleic acid, the post-acne marks remain red for a few days before disappearing completely! It’s quite expensive, but it has been the best acne patch I’ve used!\n",

It will reduce how large it gets. And if you get it during a white-head stage, it will take care of it extremely quickly. I always have these on hand! always work. keep them on as long as possible and when you take them off your skin will be perfect! These are truly a Godsend along with Clinique’s Charcoal Masque and Kate Sulfur Blemish treatment. I can’t believe how much they have made my face clear up over night little by little. These are little miracles; expensive miracles but you gotta try them!!! I’ve tried all the acne healing dots from peter Thomas Roth to drug store brands. This one takes the cake! I think these are the most effective ones yet. I had a huge zit on my chin I swear it was an okay eyesore! I bought these and immediately put one on. I can actually see the spot where your pimple is getting sucked out. When I took it of there was a circle in the middle that looked full of oil. My zit wasn’t totally gone, I tried to pop it before I got the treatment so there was some damage to my skin, but it was no longer inflamed and I wasn’t embarrassed to be in public! I wish i had a before pic!\n",
      "…read more I’m not sure if I’m right or if it’s placebo, but I feel like the aloe in these does make my pimples less noticeable and red the next day as compared to a standard hydrocolloid acne patch. These have always worked for me. I usually put them on before bed and then in the morning, you can see where the bacteria and gunk is pulled out of the skin and onto the patch. I do sometimes use them to spot treat during the day, if something has popped up randomly. It’s also really good for reducing the swelling of my acne as well. Highly recommend. Note: I do have tend to have combination skin usually during the summer and more dry skin during the winter time. If you have oily skin, might not work as well. And I don’t usually break out unless it’s that time of the month. I’ve also noticed that if you pull off and try to reapply (if you don’t like where you placed it), it doesn’t stick as well so make sure you’ll like where it’ll be before sticking it onto your skin.\n",
      "…read more I wouldn't recommend this product for cystic acne or acne that's below the surface of the skin. However, for topical acne, this stuff is an absolute miracle. I usually put some on my spots before I sleep and then peel them off in the morning and they're always full of gunk from my skin and my acne is dramatically reduced. This is one of my most repurchased items and I love it. OMG. I wish i had these magical dots as a teenager!!! They don’t work as well for deep painful cystic acne but they will reduce their redness. More to the head acne...insane. I usually wear them to bed after deep cleansing my skin and take them off in the AM! Amazing and pick up a box every time I’m in Sephora. An incredible product. Mix with my concealers and tinted moisturizers for additional aid with dryness and blending into skin for a more natural, dewy look. Purchased twice now. Writing this review because I know how much I rely on reviews when I purchase a new product. Highly recommend Really enjoying this product. It’s light weight, so I mix it with my am and pm moisturizer. It has no scent, which I also love. I will definitely buy this again when I run out. I love this product! It moisturized my skin without causing any breakouts or anything. My skin is very sensitive and this helped it a lot! Would highly recommend. I love this serum!! Very lightweight and keeps my skin hydrated all day long I absolutely love this stuff. When I started using drunk elephant (I now use the whole line) I had extremely oily skin. Like my makeup was sliding off my face in an hour oily skin. I use 2 pumps of this serum morning and night mixed with either Protini or Lala Retro and my skin has never felt so balanced. I no longer have “oily” skin. This serum and DE in general has solved what I feel are the root issues that lead to overproduction of oil (proper hydration, absorption, etc) and my skin has never felt so good. I can’t recommend the B Hydra Serum and DE products highly enough to those who have dealt with extremely oily skin. I’ve bought at least 4-5 bottles of this stuff and will continue to buy again and again. Just keep in mind this is NOT a moisturizer. This gets used in combination with a moisturizer.\n",

I do need to use this everyday, otherwise my forehead goes back to very oily. I also appreciate the size and especially the price (which is more affordable for the $$$ Drunk Elephant). It also mixes very well with both of their moisturizers.\n",
      "…read more This has been one of the best additions to my routine. My skin loves it and it lasts a long time. No excess oiliness, just hydration. I love to mix this with my tlc framboos and adds extra hydration. Easy to use and have been using for several years. I'm a big fan on this serum. I use it in conjunction with other serums and moisturizers so keep that in mind. Using this product has really alleviated the dryness in my skin. I notice that after cleansing, my skin is less dry than it used to be. It mixes really well with other products and it lasts longer than any other Drunk Elephant product I use. It's very helpful in winter. I need it every year. Definitely my favorite product of Estee Lauder. I use this both day (whenever I’m not using any other serum) and night! Feels very hydrating, absorbs quickly into the skin and just makes my skin look very glowy with just a few drops. I love the small brown bottle, it nourishes my skin. according to my wife, it is a very good product. I bought two for her I have been using this product for a week now. It completely melts into your skin with no oily or greasy residue left on your skin. I actually also use this as a primer for my makeup and I have recieved so many compliments that my skin is glowing! I am 37 years old and I feel most primers are for younger skin. I also have the oily T zone that worsens throughout the day. This completely keeps my makeup looking fresh with less oil buildup in T zone area. This completely changed my makeup routine forever!\n",
      "…read more This serum is holy grail for me! I was hesitating between this and Lancome's advanced genifique serum which both contains Bifida and are always compared in terms of their efficacy and similarities within each other. I am glad that I chose Estee Lauder as I believe working as a hydrating and repair serum, the addition of alcohol and perfume in Lancome's is just ridiculous. As I am a fan for BHA, AHA and retinol, my face can sometimes break out and be sensitized a little. The day I applied this serum before my \"radical skincare ingredients\", I found all what concerned me before--acnes, sensitization, were all gone in just as short as one night. This serum does not clog my pores nor break me out no matter how much I apply on my face. It is so wonderful in fixing problematic skin issues and can hydrating your skin without feeling greasy.\n",

I was swearing on my face because I had no confidence at all (and cries a lot) BUT when I started using this (July), I already saw the unexpected result that leads me to buy it again!! It literally removed my acne scars and my acnes started to stop growing (Thank God!!!). I’ve been using this serum for 5 months now and it is really worth the price. I have tried a lot of facials before (microneedling, microdermabrasion... and so on) and spent thousand of dollars until I found this. I would use this until I die lol.\n",

I try to do things naturally, so foolishly went cold turkey on my acne medicine. Cue forehead breakout explosion. For months my forehead has been covered in red bumps and cystic acne. I am back on medicine now and the breakouts are slowly starting to subside, but the red marks left behind are everywhere. I did not feel like I could leave the house without makeup. I went to Sephora and asked what they recommended and came home with a 5 pack of these peels to try. OMG. After ONE use I could see a huge difference. The acne I had was smaller and the red marks were significantly less noticeable. I have used them twice now and can't wait to keep going. I think these will be a new staple for me.\n",

I have continued to use daily for about a week and a half. My skin is softer, brighter, and those annoying acne marks are smaller and fainter. I will continue to use and repurchase! Work the investment in my opinion. I'm getting older (late 40's) and this stuff literally takes my skin back a few years. Shrinks pores and makes my skin look smoother I originally recieved a sample from a family member to try out. After one treatment I was in love with the way my skin felt, I purchased an entire box. I have had less/no breakouts since using on a regular basis. If I do a deep exfoliation before applying the treatment there is light burning and redness but as I had expected, nothing uncomfortable. I have recommended this product to others and will likely re-purchase.\n",
      "…read more I loved this product. I bought it to help with some dark pigmentation around my lips, and after the first use there was a small but noticeable difference. I had better results with one use of this product than a month of using dark spot cream (different brand). If I could only ever have one skin care product this would be it! I would give everything else up to keep this. I used to have heaps of bumps near my lip on my chin. Around 30 small bumps. Tried heaps of products. This is the only one that worked within a few uses. Tingles if your new to this, but it's gentle but does an amazing job. Would highly recommend! I have only been using these for a week but I am loving them so far! My face was glowing after one use and felt tight. These are quite pricy but in order to get the most value, I also use them on my chest and back. There is plenty of product on the wipe to do so. Can’t wait to see my results after all 35 treatments! I love Dr.Dennis Gross products. They really truly work. These peels changed my skin I used them for about a year. Years and years ago when I worked at Sephora my skin was so bad mostly due to hereditary cystic acne passed down from my mom. I was so afraid it would keep progressing and that I would need to go on acutane like my mom. Something I was hoping to avoid at all costs because it can be quite intense on your body. Luckily I learnt so much about this brand and had many many colleagues tell me that this specific brand will do miracles. They were right! I have used the ferulic acid and retinol pads (night time), the original formula (day time) and once a week I used to do the medi-spa peels (same strength as Dr. Dennis uses in his office). For the past two years my skin was amazing. I stopped buying the peels because my skin got so good. Now I am engaged and super super stressed out about my wedding I’m having some skin issues again. I’m not worried though because I know that these peels will be a quick month or two fix and my skin will be all balanced again. I don’t work for Sephora anymore but if I did this would still be my number one recommendation for women wanting smoother, brighter, clear, poreless looking skin. Pro tip: you can cut the pads in half and stick the other half in the fridge and get two days. Or use the full thing and also use the pads on your hands!!! Keep your hands and neck as youthful as your face. Use the pad till it’s basically dry that way you get the most use out of it.\n",

I tried blackhead removing strips, Murad’s multi acid peel, Origins charcoal mask and soooo many other things but nothing worked. These pads however...ONE use got rid of 75% of the texture on my nose and the rest of my face. I’ve tried both the Extra Strength and Universal peels by DDG and as these are now a permanent part of my routine I settled on universal just because I don’t think my skin needs such intense treatment on a daily basis. Highly highly recommend.\n",
      "…read more My moisturizer works much better using these daily. This is hands-down the best skincare product I have ever spent money on. I wish I took before and after photos. The past few months my usually tame (but very sensitive) skin started breaking out, leaving scars, and having noticeable discoloration- to the point I was wearing foundation every day so I didn’t have to see it (I’m sure that didn’t help at all). So in desperation, I started using these Dr Gross pads- first every other day, then daily. Now, after a month of using the pads, my skin looks great, scars have faded, skin tone has evened out, and I now love leaving the house without foundation! HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THIS PRODUCT: - The slight tingling sensation after putting on Step 1 may feel weird at first, but it’s expected since it is a peel. Like the instructions say, use the product every other day if it feels too much. - USE SUNSCREEN! This should be a given every day, but it’s especially important with this product. You can actually damage your skin if you use this product without applying skinscreen. - I personally like applying this product in the evening, but the instructions say you can use it in the AM / PM.\n",
      "…read more Must have, leave skin so smooth and soft. Helps with blackheads too. It’s lil pricy if use everyday but 100% worth it Love these! I have sensitive skin so I was a bit nervous to try these but despite the first initial stinging they are actually quite gentle on the skin and it’s helped with my dark spots and acne scarring. Definitely recommend! Worth the splurge. I’m constantly buying new products and I’m all about skincare. This will 100% be a part of my everyday routine. I received a sample in the Sephora hydration sample kit and I immediately went online to buy the full size. Glad I found a product that is officially part of my starting lineup. I use it every morning and every night. After one week, I’ve noticed clearer skin. Super moisturizing without the stickiness. Great during the cold, dry winter months. Totally fine in the summer too. I don't use a lot. I like to use it under makeup when my skin is dry so my foundation doesn't look flakey on my skin. I bought the 100mL size exactly a year ago and I'm only halfway done with the bottle! My skin is very dry in the winter because of the climate here in Texas so I'm eager to try new things. After only one day of using this, I noticed amazing results. It made my skin so much softer and smoother. The price is a little steep compared to other products but for the results I had from using this for only one day, I totally recommend it. I love how a little goes a long way with this product. My skin feels and looks better after using this. The only thing I would change would be the way it’s dispensed, a pump would be better. This product is just amazing , it’s little pricey but it worth the money . I've been wanting to buy this since trying a sample from Le Mer. Bought during the VIB sale, good value. Glad I got the full size. Good product, left my skin soft and feeling refreshed. Watery treatment is the first and foremost step of my skincare regimen. This lotion is an indispensable member of my skincare army. Amazing product, it really hydrates your skin, the skin absorbs the product quite fast, I don’t use a cotton pad to apply it, I apply it with my fingertips, it’s worth the price and the bottle lasts a long time. A must buy! The best lotion for my skin. This with the soft cream is just awesome Love this to prep the skin. If your trying to use this line .. this is a must along with the moisturizer. It’s worth it !!! A few drops is all you need it’s like pure silky hydration! It makes my skin feel so soft and plump it will also last a long time a few drops is all you need. Love love love I love how hydrating this is compared to IOPE Bio-Essence, SK-II, and other similar treatment lotions. It is just slightly thicker in the texture, but the hydration goes deeper and holds longer than other products. La Mer has to be the worst thing that has happened to my bank account. All of their skincare products just have amazing results on my skin. Highly recommend and will buy it again Omg! Worth it. I finally purchased this badass during Rough Sale. I can totally tell the different by using this Lamer Lotion within a week. My acne, blemish skin calmed down dramatically. I only use about 2-3 drops, and it covers entire face. Don’t waste it on cotton pad, just put on my palm, gently tap it on my face after my cleanser. Feels little sticky at first, but went away afterward. Very light sense, feel luxurious. I use this toner morning and night. I’m sure this bottle will last me for a while. Definitely will re-purchase again in future. I normally use ArmorePacific Essence after the toner... but might opt to this lotion going forward.\n",

Because it’s pricey, I tend to reserve this for my rainy days (ie when my skin just looks blah or when I’ve over-exfoliated). It’s incredibly nourishing and feels like I’m applying a protective second layer of skin. It has a velvety finish, and just feels luxurious. Scent is pleasant too. My favourite LA Mer product. You will only need to use a tiny amount at a time so get the smallest size as it will last you. This product is exceptional at accelerating post pimple healing. I have fairly clear skin, but everyone gets pimples now and again. I first tried this on an unprecedented double pimple on my chin that had not healed after months. Within a few days the residual was noticeably smaller. Incredible. This is the stuff! Magic in a bottle. My daughter had some minor acne scars and I bit the bullet and bought some. Her skin is GORGEOUS! It is killing me to buy a second bottle but I will buy this for her for eternity based on the results we have had. I wish it wasn’t so pricy because I’d sure like a bottle for myself! Can't live without! Makes a difference and everyone can tell when I am not using it! Smells great, smooth skin and fine lines. Decreases redness. There is nothing in the world that could ever compare to The Concentrate by La Mer. It is magic in a bottle, simply put. I can guarantee that any poor reviews are misleading and inherently false. Do not use a sample, stores have a tendency of not discarding them after the expiration date. The shelf life from production is approximately two years, all of which is traceable through the lot number on the boxes. La Mer makes their product’s very transparent, and the maximum potency well known, with each hand made batch traced back to the exact lab and scientist that created it. You can’t put a price on flawless skin, it’s what everyone is searching for, and The Concentrate delivers on every promise.\n",

I have sun spots from a sunburn last summer and this product is fading them fast. I've been disappointed with corrective solutions in the past so I was guardedly optimistic about this one. To my delight, it worked. I've been using it for about two months now and it continues to improve my skin. I use it after cleaning with Caudalie's Vinopore pore purifying gel. It didn't take long to see results. I use just a tiny bit so it’s a thin layer on my face mostly where I have acne scars AFTER my face has been washed in the morning and GOD this stuff is amazing. It did take a while (I’d say maybe a few weeks probably cause they were so dark) initially but after constant use my scars went away. Obviously if I get new scars now I just continue putting this on but it works miraculously faster now.

This is a must buy It really works I notice my dark marks (hyperpigmentation) fading ever since using this product. This is such a great product. I use in the morning with my sunscreen and it gives such a great glow. I never use a whole pump just a small squirt and it’s concentrated so it goes a long way. Highly recommend! I have mature pale skin so thought I would give this a try. I have used it about half a dozen times now and do not use much but mix it in with other drunk elephant products to give my skin a very subtle bit of color I love what the Sunshine Drops do to my favorite sunscreen or moisturizer. It’s cut my application time down to nil and looks great with just a swipe of illuminating bronzer. No foundation necessary. Makes my skin look so good! Gives my skin really nice color. I always mix it with a gel and only really use a little because it goes a long way. I love to add this to moisturizer or to my Kosas face oil for summer. Adds a great glow, also use it on its own for a bronzer. Not sure how much this improved my skin, but it definitely didn't hurt it, and gives a great natural glow! No issues with consistency when I mix it with serum, primers, foundation, etc. Blending this into my regular tinted moisturizer also saves me from having to change by \"base\" seasonally. A little goes a long way and I am VERY happy with how long one tube has lasted, I bought a second tube when I thought I was low and still haven't opened it - that was two months ago!\n",

Plus it’s anti-pollution, so your skin is always protected I am a D-Bronzi fan. I appreciate the anti-pollution properties since I live in a city.

I have super oily (large pores), acne-prone skin and was thinking this product wasn’t going to have much of an impact on my skin. All the recommendations I had received were from dry-skin types so needless to say I was cautiously optimistic. One night was all it took to set aside my reservations.

I had gotten used to being disappointed by high-end skin care that don’t perform well on oily skin but this has actually delivered tangible results. I’ve been using it consistently day and night for two weeks and my skin is still hydrated and luminous but also fine lines are blurred, pores seem smaller, my overall texture seems more even. I’m sure some of my other products have definitely aided in all the improvements I’ve seen but I’m positive Genifique has helped my other products work more effectively.

Now, I’m just going to see how my skin looks over the next few weeks. But, I already love this product! I can definitely see myself buying another bottle! I had received a sample of this product and loved it so much I had to order even with the high price point. I am crazy about serums and the results start to show so quick on this that I had to have it! I alternate between physical and chemical exfoliants so I don't use this everyday, but it took a good 6 months to go through this. The formula is great. Some chemical exfoliants make me break out in tons of tiny red bumps everywhere (e.g. Glossier toner) but these haven't bothered my skin at all. If I thoroughly rub the pad all over, it really does give me a glow. I use these every night and love them. I have dry sensitive skin and haven't had any reactions. They are a bit on the expensive side and I've heard of people cutting them in half to make them go further but they're kind of a pain to cut so I can't be bothered. I don't mind paying a bit extra if something works. Sometimes you get a better deal on these if you get them in a boxed set so check the prices because some of the promo sets come with them a bit cheaper and you get some other stuff that you may not need but if it's free who cares!\n",
      "…read more These live up to the other reviews! I rarely have had anything work like it says - but these do! I'm 41, and have better skin now than in my 30's. It's clear, and glowing. (minus the fine lines LOL) I will be buying more from this line...new obsession :) My skin has gotten really sensitive as I’ve gotten older, and these exfoliate but are gentle enough not to hurt my skin - I love them! I’ve never used an AHA before. After my first night applying to my face, I woke up with smoother skin and was SHOCKED. It is gentle enough not to make my sensitive, acne prone skin red and tight but potent enough to see an overnight difference! These saved my face. Winters are very cold and dry and my face was falling apart and these got rid of the dry skin! I have fair, sensitive, acne prone skin. I'm also pregnant! I have been using these pads for 2 months and my skin is looking great! I've done well in the past with glycolic and lactic acid based products, so I knew this probably would not irritate my skin. I'm not sure if it's a change in my hormones in the second trimester, the use of this product, or some combination of the two, but skin is clear of breakouts and the texture is much improved. Will continue using even after pregnancy.\n",
      "…read more I love this exfoliating pads! I noticed a difference almost immediately in my skin. I found then gentle enough for everyday use. I always get a few annoying little red spots, particularly around my nose and chin and décolleté. These pads INSTANTLY take them away though. I’ve been using these for about two weeks and I am in love. They really do help brighten and tone the skin. I’m shocked at how fast I’ve seen results. My only concern with these though is their environmental impact as they are cotton pads that are being tossed in the trash. Just something to think about.\n",
      "…read more I hate that I love these! The drugstore versions of these don’t compare, and the concentration of glycolic acid is low, and they’re filled with fragrance, which is super sensitizing. I have VERY dry, VERY sensitive skin, and FAB just gets it right when it comes to sensitive skin. Everyone needs a little exfoliation in their life, but most acids make my skin burn, and it turns red and blotchy. These provide just the right amount of exfoliation without irritating my skin, and the pads last WAY longer if you cut them in half! I use them ~ 3 nights a week (using an acid every night can damage your skin barrier,) and both the big and small size of these pads last forever!\n",
      "…read more Buy this product! It's amazing. I was looking for something alcohol and fragrance free to help with my acne and acne scars. I was using this expensive PTR serum which was helpful for a bit bit eventually lost its effectiveness. These pads have helped keep all my breakout in check, diminishes scarring and gives me a nice glow. It's a holy grail product. I rarely get breakouts anymore, and if I do, they are gone almost immediately. I use this with the FAB face moisturizer with a pump and the FAB pure skin cleanser. My skin has never been better. Just a tip: do cut them in half. They are very saturated, and all you need is half.\n",
      "…read more Such an effective yet gentle product! Definitely keeps my skin clear and bright! I love the convenience of this- daily exfoliation and toner in one! I can be super sensitive and this doesn’t irritate! Definitely worth it! Travels well with me! This product is promising! I’m seeing some visible difference in my tone...it’s brighter and I’m seeing some dark patches on my cheeks lightening up. Can’t wait to see what use of the whole bottle brings. Soaks into skin and an actually skip moisturizer without noticing. Great scent too! Love this product!!! My pores looks smaller and my skin is so smooth. Yup, it’s a winner!!! Not sticky like some serums, glides on great. I use a rose quartz roller after I apply. HIGHLY recommend. Star product, in the dry winter, this essence effect is really great This one is my favourite. I have dry skin and this serum can help me with this issue :) Only product I have used that actually has reduced my dark spots My absolute favorite serum. I love that it’s duel phased and that I can control how much product comes out with the top dial. The scent is nothing offensive and I noticed a difference in my skin within the first week as well as got compliments by people asking what I’ve been using. This is great for anyone who is noticing any signs of aging and wants to start taking action. I love that clarins products are made from plants as well.\n",
      "…read more Honestly, this product is worth every stupid penny I paid and I hate it because it’s so expensive. But it has made my skin so beautiful. I randomly got a sample of this one time and immediately had to buy it it was THAT good. I have these slight wrinkles starting on my forehead and I started using it once a day and the wrinkles are now almost nonexistent. Plus my face is generally red from acne scarring I had and now my skin is a much more even tone. I let my best friend use this serum one time and she went out and bought it the next day. It just makes your skin so radiant and luminous and has helped with my redness, acne, winter dryness, and fine lines. If I had to choose between eating for a week and buying this serum, I’d honestly starve that’s how much I love this product. My only regret is not taking before and after photos. Highly recommend, if that wasn’t already obvious haha\n",

During the period I was using it( on at night) my acne was stable which is all I wanted. Highly recommend for acne skin and oily skin type. My skin routine with it is 1)facial wash. 2) essence toner, 3) this serum X 2, 4) acne treatment. i like this light texture serum..its provide the skin amazing shine, i usually put it before i go to sleep...this is my second time to purchase this product . A MUST HAVE! I have dry skin and this serum is the only one that works for me without drying it more! I never thought of clarins as a good brand, then I tried this because of the reviews and I love it! I purchased this after getting a sample from a sephora employee in store, it's a bit on the pricey side but i decided to give it a try, i use this in combination with an essence. My first reaction is- it absorbs into my skin, no sticky residue, skin feels plump and hydrated instantly. I decided to give this a try under makeup during the day- my foundation with primer went on like a dream and stayed on it didnt break up. I'm pretty impressed, my pores are noticeably smaller and my dry patchy areas are gone. This is going to be another repurchase for me holy grail. The results i got were long term not short term but with continued use.\n",
      "…read more I’ve been using this serum for a little over 2 months and it’s done wonders for my skin, after about a week I noticed my skin was smoother and makeup went on smoother and 2-3 weeks my skin was always healthy looking (less dull) definitely worth the price and the best out of the 3 popular serums (Advanced night repair, Genifique) (Full disclosure, when I started using this product I also started using a different toner, moisturizer, and added an essence to my skin care routine) okay, so since I’ve been using this product my skin has been amazing. I waited almost a full month to pose a review because I wanted to see how it REALLY worked. My skin has never been more clear. Not sure if it’s solely from this serum or a combo of new skin care routine but wow.. people have been telling me I look like I’m glowing! Very satisfied. I will definitely repurchase.\n",
      "…read more This is my all time favorite serum. It is a bit pricey, but for sure worth it. I use it as a part of my morning routine. It brightens my face without leaving an oily residue. I can never go without! This serum is the absolute best on the market and a little goes a long way. I noticed that my skin felt baby soft after application and I began to see my fine lines look like they were starting to fill in within a matter of days! This will be a staple in my beauty regimen from now on. I am a big fan of Origins, and so when this popped up saying it would help reduce redness, I was curious. I have always had a naturally red face and had just accepted it. I read the reviews and people seemed pleased, so I gave it a shot. I am impressed! A month in and my skin has never been less red! The solution is essentially water, and acts more like a toner. I’ve been using it day and night and have been pleasantly surprised. My skin looks and feels healthier. Other people complained about the smell, but I never had an issue with it, it is so mild. If you are someone with oily skin and redness, I recommend this for you, it kept my face matte, and has been eliminating redness.\n",
      "…read more I have very sensitive skin that has started to get drier with age. I added this \"lotion\" into my regimen about 4 months ago and absolutely love how my skin feels now. The only qualm I have is that it is not really a lotion and I feel like I waste some product when I apply. It is very liquidy (think of it more like a soothing toner with moisturizing properties). I apply this after washing my face and then top with my regular moisturizer. It is a great in between to soothe my skin and I do feel like it adds moisture and suppleness. I have completely skipped moisturizer after and unless it is a particularly dry day (aka winter) I feel like my skin is hydrated enough. Some reviews say there is a scent... I honestly don't notice one and have a pretty sensitive sense of smell.\n",
      "…read more I ran across this product while looking for something to help combat inflammation. When I checked it out in the store, I almost didn't buy it because it had the consistency of water (I wasn't familiar with the concept of an essence at the time), and I thought \"what could this possibly do.\" I bought it anyway—and have now repurchased more than once. I use it morning and night, and it has really helped with inflammation. I finally have a normal skin color that isn't always pink!\n",

      "…read more Truly an amazing product. Ever since I’ve started using it my complexion has been super even which is a struggle for me in the Winter. It makes my skin glowy, soft and helped with my redness- to the point where I skip foundation most days now. Super soothing on dry, irritated skin from the cold weather! My HG toner, especially in the winter time. Feels really soothing being applied and helps prep my skin for serums and creams. This stuff is awesome! Leaves your skin soft, reduced me redness, and just the best, and I love the smell for some reason, it's nice and earthy! Love this stuff! I have super sensitive, combination skin that breaks out and I got turned onto this on Monday and it has been amazing! Toner, but it isn't drying, takes away redness, any zits disappear overnight, my pores look smaller and my skin feels softer. I still moisturize even though it is a moisturizing toner. LOVE IT. Have felt more comfortable without foundation ever since! Absolutely fantastic when my moisture barrier was destroyed and my skin was red, irritated and painful. Really expensive, but it's quite a large bottle! Love this product! Calms my skin and evens out of skin tone. It’s not harsh and has improved my skins overall appearance! Really recommend! never one to write reviews, but I have very acne prone and dehydrated skin and this toner has made a massive difference. pat it on my skin day and night and it is hydrating and soothing, skin has been so clear and glowy since I started using this. staple in my skin care forever now!! Oh my goodness. Literal goodness. I recently used a vitamin c serum from a different brand that left my skin SO damaged. It was red like I had a sunburn, peeling and flaky all over, I was breaking out, and my face felt so itchy and irritated. After much research I decided to try a megamushroom set and have been using it for just 2 days. OMG my skin has NEVER felt this hydrated and calm before. In 2 days it has completely taken away all of my redness , my skin feels completely soothed and calmed, and I only have a few spots of healing acne where it still a bit dry at the end of the day/when I wake up. And most importantly it isn’t breaking me out. The consistency is like water so I was skeptical but it does feel so good immediately upon putting it onto my face. I’m so thankful !\n",
      "…read more I got a sample of this in my Sephora Play box and started trying it, thinking it was honestly kind of a gimmick. It’s not. This stuff WORKS. My skin has always been a struggle for me and using this over the past month has made such a difference. Worth every penny. Shopping for more Origins products as we speak. I actually only use this soothing treatment lotion if I've been a little rough with washing my face or have picked at anything. For inflicted irritation, I've noticed this product does calm down my redness and swelling within several minutes. For that purpose, it's been a miracle product for me! This has completely changed the texture of my skin. It feels so smooth and I have noticed a difference in brightness. I just started using it on my chest for dark spots so I am anxious for the results. This is a staple in my everyday skincare. I got a sampler using points and I really love how my skin reacts to it. I’ve noticed a smoother complexion and less texture. It also smells so great. I use in the morning after my La Mer treatment lotion. My skin is glowing! I’m so glad I’ve discovered this brand last year because I have so many of their products. They’re potent, smell great, and amazing price point. One of my goals this year is to have a clear skin and this serum made it happen! Yes, I have achieved my goal in less than a month. I can now go out without foundation. I’m now on a hunt for a tinted moisturizer for that “no make up” days. Truly worth every penny! I like this serum a lot. It gives my skin a very bright healthy glow. After using for two weeks consistently my skin is glowing. It makes me look brighter. I haven't really had any breakouts that I noticed since using this serum. I would definitely recommend. I like the purple tint to it. It smells good as well. I love using this serum! I have tried several bakuchiol products and this is my favorite so far...with results and texture. I may try a cheaper brand next time just because of my budget, but so far this is my winner. I used to use the DE Retinol and it worked wonders for me but then I got pregnant and retinols became a big no for my skincare routine. My pregnancy brought me good skin but after giving birth, my skin turned dull and uneven in texture but I can't go back to retinols just yet because now I am breastfeeding, so I tried Vit C and AHAs but nothing seemed to work then this product came up when I was researching and it was the best serum ever. Indeed glowing skin and it brought brightness and smoothness to my face. I will purchase another bottle and continue to use it even after breastfeeding.\n",

When I first used this product coworkers were telling me my skin was glowing, asking if I had work done, and just how great looked. I instantly knew this product was worth the money. I love it. As someone who suffers from cystic acne, enlarged pores and uneven skin tone, this is the only product that has helped me! I put this on every night and morning. As someone who was unable to leave the house without makeup, I can finally walk out of my house without worrying about my skin looking red and my large pores visible. I also use this as a primer and I was recently recently photographed close up (accidentally I went by someone's phone whilst they were taking a picture). Normally, I would have requested they delete it immediately, however I viewed the picture, zoomed in and could not believe how minimal my pores were. I had stopped using this for some time because of the price though.

I’m over 45 and so hydration is important. Not only does this product add moisture to skin, it helps with texture. I saw quick results. Worth the $ since you don’t need a lot for each use.

I haven't been using it for a month and I already have an amazing glow, my skin tone evened out and my huge pores on my nose are smaller! Last night for the FIRST time in my life I put on foundation and I was like.....This foundation is covering the glow the Lancome gives me.

It really helps my dry skin during the winter months and doesn’t break me out. I use this for acne scars and my dry skin and it has made a huge difference In my skin. The vitamin c is good for my acne scars and the h.a. is for my dry skin. Sometimes if my skin is a little sensitive it burns but I like that feeling.

As a woman who has always taken pride in my skin, This miraculously and drastically helps with the fine lines in my skin. This one one of my absolute MOST favorite skin care products. My skin has been glowing since I started using this. I use it twice daily, just after cleansing and toning. It has a neutral scent, doesn't make my skin sting and is great with my sensitive skin. I also think that it has done a good job at helping with fine lines and discoloration from the sun/my melasma. Love this stuff! It makes you look “blurry.” I use it as a primer and it’s literally game changing. If you're scared of trying retinol because of the irritation it can cause - give this a go. This is the only option I have found that doesn't irritate. received it as a free sample and have now bought full size I love this product. My skin feels so soft and I LOVE the way it smells.

It is a part of my nightly cleansing routine. I LOVE this product and I love Biossance. It is one of my go-to skincare lines. This product is worth. every. dollar. I decided to buy this based on a recommendation by a cosmetic chemist. It has rave marks on the Environmental Working Group. Basically every trusted source I look to, had positive things to say about it... even to the extent that this natural retinol is better than the actual thing. I have used it for 28 days to see how it fares over a skin cycle. It lives up to the hype. I’m 37 and have come to terms with a new budget line for skincare going forward.

I was very skeptical about adding oil to my already oily face but gave it a chance based on a friend's recommendation. I am so glad I did.

You might not see results before you use the tiny bottle (I didn't), so you can always purchase a second trial kit to give it another chance. You'll get a very good cleanser and moisturizer in each, which I use for travel! 2. Results are guaranteed! I grew up with a million freckles and I absolutely adored them. I only became concerned with hyperpigmentation around May of 2019 (five months ago) due to some dark marks where I had pretty serious hormonal breakouts. I had two large spots, one on the tip of my nose and one on my chin, which caused me to seek out some solutions for dark spots. 3. You MUST wear sunscreen with this product. My favorites are the Coola Sun Silk Drops for workdays, school, etc., but if you're going to be at the beach, use the Murad Environmental-C cleanser (it's safe and environmentally friendly)! Not only has this product completely erased my acne marks, but now my freckles have faded and my skin is luminous. Between this and my daily use of sunscreen now, my skin looks incredible.\n",
      "…read more I have an annoying dark spot on my face. An employee was showing someone else her pictures from using this product. She was older (thank you Sephora for hiring across the age board) and I was impressed by her pitch. I have been using it daily at night and the age spot is less annoying. Can’t wait to see how it looks in another few months. It saved me from going to get laser. I just recently started using this product again and let me tell you i am a believer. I have really stubborn dark spots that i was not able to get rid of. If you use it as directed and are patient you will see results. I have been religiously using this product for about a 4-6 weeks and my dark spots are nearly gone. Just remember to wear SPF the following morning. This stuff is straight up magic. I have been using it for about a week and I haven't broken out at all. My pores look FANTASTIC. I am in love. Definitely pair with a moisturizer to avoid dryness, but makes my makeup and my bare skin look bomb. Folks, My pores are so big you could plant a tree inside of them. This serum has made a significant difference in keeping them clean on a daily basis even with layers of skincare and makeup. A clean pore is a smaller looking pore. I apply this 2x/day after toner and essence, but before other serums, moisturizer and sunscreen. My Tips... 1). It potentially can be drying if you don’t use a moisturizer. 2). Sunscreen is a must when using this during the day. 3). The pump dispenses too much. You only need a half-pump to cover your entire t-zone. Therefore this bottle will last a very long time!!! 4) Before buying this listing, see if Sephora has it available as a gift set as that will save you money and/or score you additional products at the same price. Just search Caudalie in Sephora search bar to look for value gift sets.\n",

I use two pumps morning and night before my moisturizer (I use Tatcha Water Cream), and I have seen insanely amazing results. If you have small breakouts or are looking to minize pores, this is a must have. This product really works! I used it for months and was happy with the way my pores looked. Then I ran out and stopped using it. I was horrified to discover after a couple of weeks (of not using the serum) how huge my pores had gotten! So ya, it really works and I’m repurchasing it. I wish I had started using this product sooner. I see results already and it's only been a week. My skin is clearing up and it's overall appearance looks so much better than it used to! I never write reviews, but will definitely go out of my way for this product! I did not have high hopes for this product when I first purchased it, and I had tried MANY other serums (including the Sunday Riley UFO oil) but nothing worked as effectively as this for my combo, acne prone skin. I noticed the most difference with small hormonal bumps I was getting on my chin...they are gone! I use this once a day however, and only on my t-zone (not my dry cheeks).\n",

Within one week of using this serum, my visible pores on my nose have been reduced by almost one half. Now I can look in my 15x mirror and like what I see. I haven’t noticed any excessive drying of the skin - but I am only using this on the nose area where I tend to be “oily”. It leaves a light, non sticky feel to the skin, much like a makeup primer. Definitely on my ‘Must have’ list for skin care.\n",

I let it sink in for a good 10 min, then layer a simple moisturizer over top. I like multi-step complicated skin regimens, but I think mixing too many things with this serum may interfere with the active ingredients. I found it didn't work well when I layered too many products over top. On it's own with a simple moisturizer - amazing results. Really helped me, made a noticeable difference in my skin.\n",

I LOVE it as a spot treatment as well, the smell of it is just an extra add on! Its 100%, my holy grail product. This definitely minimized Pores. I absolutely love. I’m currently on my second bottle. I also use Caudalie moisturizing toner. I also want to add I’ve been also using Perricone MD intensive pore minimizing toner. You can barely see my pores. Great for oily skin. You feel refreshed, renewed, moisturized and as if you were on the beach in Italy. Caudalie always brings such class. This brand will live on forever. The HOLY GRAIL of Collagen!!!. I was shocked at how good this works. Hands down, this is one of my favorite products from Algenist. It’s basically fragrance free.. which I LOVE. It feels so good on my skin & actually works. I use this day & night! I recently received the 10 sample pack of this serum with my online order. I was kinda skeptical at first but let me tell you I’m in my early 40’s and I have a few fine lines at my eye area.. I haven’t even finished the whole pack yet and I’ve already noticed the lines under my eyes are literally disappearing!! They look so much smoother! I’ve been using 1 little pack twice a day!

What sold me on it was that she told she uses it herself and that her skin was amazing. I’ve been using this (plus the cleanser, face cream, eye serum eye cream) for two weeks and my skin has never looked better. My skin feels hydrated and balanced. It’s glowing!

My skin looks so much smoother and more flawless with this serum. I'm ready to buy stock in Farsáli! Will repurchase this primer again and again. I love this product! I have dry skin but I can get oily in my t zone with makeup. This gives me a matte look without being overly drying. Okay, I had to come write a review. I used this for the first time this past weekend and I was like \"meh\" - didn't notice much of a difference. So I was kinda disappointed cuz Jackie Aina RAVES about this stuff. I tried it again this morning...except this time instead of putting it underneath my MILK hydro-grip, I put it over top. And oh my god....my pores are non-existent. My skin looks SO GOOD. No pores/texture showing through, which is saying a lot for my skin. AND, my skin is matte in all the right areas. I've read a lot of reviews about how there isnt a lot of product in here- so I'll be interested to see how long this lasts. I'm bummed about the price, but if it lasts a while, I'll totally shell out the cash for it. This is honestly worth the hype. No pore-filling primer has ever gotten this reaction out of me. I love it.\n",

(based on jackie aina’s recommendation) and it is tremendous. you can literally see a difference as soon as you put it on. if you’re on the fence about buying it, DO IT. THIS IS YOUR SIGN. I love the Farsali brand! I’ve used the gold elixir and couldn’t get enough... this is the first time using the primer and I don’t know how I’ve gone so long without it! I put this over my face makeup. I know that’s not the intended use but I heard it works and it does! I find it smoothes my makeup out and makes my face looks amazing in photos!!!!! Amazing product and dose exactly what the description says!!! This product is amazing. When you apply this gel on your skin the dead skin cells actually ball up and exfoliate right off! It’s really great when my skin gets dry as it helps take all the flakes right off. You only need this about once a week. At first I wasn’t sure if it was the product itself balling up or actual skin cells so I started testing it by using it a second time and there was barely any balling of the gel. I highly recommend it!!!\n",

I don’t write reviews often but this stuff is awesome. It leaves your skin feeling so soft and exfoliated afterwards. I’ve tried so many exfoliants from scrubs to chemicals and nothing works like this. It’s also pretty cool how you literally feel the dead skin balling up. I use it about once a week so one bottle lasts a while. Definitely worth the price! My boyfriend got me this and it’s just amazing! You can see all the dead skins going away! This stuff is amazing! I dont do it that often but I do use it at least a couple of times a month. When I first used it I wasn't expecting to have skin peeling all over my face but I guess I didn't really know what the mask was all about. Now when using it I am still amazed with how much dead skin comes off. It's almost gross but at the same time its awesome how well the product works. My face feels amazing afterwards. I would totally recommend this product to others and I will be purchasing again. I started with a sample size and have moved to the full size and happy I did.\n",

(Been using it for about 3 months) I use it to get rid of any icky extra texture that tends to make my makeup look cakey or just not clean/smooth. The product is super mild, so I use it everyday after cleansing and toner and before any primer. It makes such a huge difference in the appearance(Or less there of) my foundation / face makeup. I currently use a high percentage RETIN A cream for acne which obviously leads to dry skin patches in some parts. I know this is normal with the medication but makes wearing makeup look not so smooth and makes the dry patches stand out even more. I use some of this on my dry skin and massage it in for a minute and the patches are gone. These dry patches are not just brushed off easily either THEY ARE STUBBORN. I have tried applying makeup without using this, seen the patches UGH, removed makeup and used this, and went to reapply and BOOM no more patches. I am on my 7 tube and can't wear makeup unless using this before hand.\n",

Will definitely buy this again! Love! This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee due to having issues with exfoliating my t zone. I have combination oily/dry skin and sometimes it’s both in the same spot. This peeling gel is gentle enough in my sensitive areas and strong enough for the tough to exfoliate areas like creases of my nose and around my eye brows.

      "…read more First off, I have super sensitive medium-tone skin that is both oily and dry depending on the time of year and temperatures. In the fall and winter I get eczema on my face, mostly at my temples and jaw line. I will admit that with 70-80 percent of products I try, I end up breaking out on my skin...even from SPF or the type of oil included. For example, I cannot use foundation with SPF and I even break out if I use Moroccan Oil hair products. Keep this in mind because if you have eczema, especially on your face... I’m going to continue as to why this is 5 stars. I have tried almost all facial creams and have been prescribed antibiotics to clear my peeling skin for ten years each fall and I struggle to keep my makeup on for the full day because my skin gets so dry and flaky that I sometimes exfoliated multiple times a day just to prevent the embarrassing redness and dryness. I NEVER would have paid this much for a product/tried a product claiming (without explanation) to roll off dead skin without irritation given my reaction to most products. However, over Christmas I was staying at my place I rent out to a makeup artist in the Midwest and she told me to help myself to her products. Within 2 days of exfoliating with this product and applying a VERY thin layer of my eczema topical cream before moisturizing with Tatcha Water Cream (which I also tried for the first time because of my renter) and my skin had not been this beautifully and clear with any other combination. I have tried 8-9 different topical creams (both steroid and non-steroid) and honestly I cannot even express how shocked I was that this product with Tatcha Water Cream made my skin look flawless AND FELT SOOOOO good. The overall feeling of my skin when I move it after exfoliating and moisturizing is better than any SPA facial I’ve spent hundreds on; I encourage and recommend this product to anyone else who struggles with redness, skin sensitivity, dry skin and eczema as a face wash and solution.\n",

Enzyme ones, physical ones, everything. But this is the only thing that actually fixes the problem. Leaves skin smooth and clear, not red and irritated. Would highly recommend! So gooooooood!! A Sephora rep told me to try this for my dry skin. But first she said, “this is sooo disgusting!” She put some on my winter chapped skin and instantly my hand flaked ha. Sooo gross but it’s soo awesome knowing your getting all those flakes of skin off your face in a non abrasive way! Will also include in my skin care routine. Love it! I bought this on a whim after seeing it on the shelf, and I’m so happy I did! I use it, my brother uses it, I’ve gotten my friends to fall in love with it. Definitely moisturize after use! It makes such a visible difference immediately. I will never use a physical exfoliant again! This product is amazing! I recommend it to all my friends and family. WOW WOW WOW! I get crazy bad flaky skin in winter and this saves my skin. Nothing works like this. Nothing. Just rub it on for a little bit and you can see it take the dry skin off. Afterwards my skin glows. GLOWS! I’ve tried all sorts of exfoliators to get rid of dry skin but this is by far the best. My skin is sensitive and I have zero reaction to this. It is a holy grail skin product. 10/10 would recommend. I used it every night for a few days and I quickly see the improvement. Now, I am obsessed with it. I wish I knew about it earlier. This product is great! If you are working to move away from harsh drying agents this is the right product for you. It works wonders. This stuff really works. My teenage daughter was having terrible hormonal breakouts and we tried something from the ordinary for acne which barely put a dent in it (and I happen to love all the other ordinary products I’ve used). Once she started this we saw an almost immediate improvement. This really clears up the skin. This stuff is magic. Put it on overnight and your blemishes will be gone or reduced by the morning. Will buy again. Results are honestly super noticeable in a day ! This Product is great. Application is easy as well, nothing but positive results no irritation no odd smell . The formula has great strength yet it is very good for sensitive skin, it’s really amazing how such small bottle can create big results. Amazing! It’s no over night cure all but it definitely helps reduce blemishes Drastically Works well and clears acne quickly. I would recommend this. So ive had a cyst like blemish on my face for about 2 weeks. Everything i tried would dry out the top of the skin but not shrink it. So i saw this at Sephora and remembered i had seen a lot of great review so i decided to try it and within 2 days the blemish has decreased more than half its size! Don't expect immediate results on the first try, be patient it works!! This is much more affective than the Mario Badescu version. I had a severe cystic breakouts recently and using this every night has definitely help soothe down the breakouts. I use this product one to two times a week. It helps me get rid of inflamed acne. Using a cotton swab, I take some product and place it over my acne. Do not shake the bottle. It soothes and dries out the pimples very well. Do not over use or else you will get dry patches from the alcohol. I was hesitant to use this product at first because of the alcohol but it really does work! This is my first review on Sephora, because this product is worth EVERY Penny. I am in my late-twenties, normal skin and noticed some fine lines on my forehead, nothing too crazy, but it was something that started to bother me. After using the serum for 1 week I already saw noticeable differences! This is the first product to deliver results in such a short time. Of course, this won't get rid of everything, but it does hold whats promised.\n",

I have yet to find a primer like this one. hydrates the skin and leaves it with an AMAZING glow under or on top of makeup. LOV LOVE LOVE THIS. MAC has a similar product but it doesn't hit the same Somedays you can skip foundation with this primer, it gives a nice glow to your skin After years of trying different primers I always end up coming back to this one. It adds a nice glow to the skin without any viable shimmer or glitter, and does not clog my pores. Only downside is if you use a lot it can pill and there seems to be a fragrance to it which can irritate sensitive skin. I use this under the It Cosmetics CC cream and Urban Decay All Nighter and it works well with both. Love this primer, an employee recommended it to me and it gives me a surprisingly natural look to my makeup. So far it’s definitely my go to This is a beautiful primer, used under makeup or even just putting a layer on those no make up days adds just a beautiful glow for the skin! Need to pick up another one! I love this! I have bought over and over again. I was very surprised to see disappointing reviews. Obviously no product is a miracle worker, but this does provide a backlit effect under makeup, just as it says. I love this primer! It's not heavy and it gives me a beautiful glow. Initially the amount of glow scared me!! I put it on my face and I felt like I looked too shiny. After applying my foundation and setting powder, I became OBSESSED with this primer! It really has the prettiest natural glow and became one of my favorite primers. Also my make up stays on all day and looks great. I will def be repurchasing! Sit closer and look at my skin. It looks amazing! I am always weary of anything to put on my face. My skin is wicked dry and everything feels cakey. Not with this. This makes me look like I have some inner glow and the confidence of Kim Kardashian. It is light weight and not greasy in the least. A wonderful purchase! I suffer from cystic acne and this product does exactly what is necessary. It helps clear up cystic and surface level blemishes. I am currently using it with Drunk Elephants Retinol and the peeling and overturn of skin cells is helping my skin heal. I would recommend using the smooth side of the pad if your skin is sensitive. I’ve been using tit twice a day for over a week and have already noticed a change!\n",
      "…read more I absolutely love this product! I have read other reviews, and I will agree with some. This product is astringent. It will hurt if you have open, active, acne cysts, just the same that rubbing alcohol will. It was recommended to me by a Sephora employee to cut the pad in half to extend the shelf life. I cut all 60 pads in half with sterile scissors after initially opening the jar. I also pour a few teaspoons of rubbing alcohol in the bottom of the jar after initially opening the jar, to prevent it from drying out. It takes time for this product to work. Using it twice a week and eventually every other day, will clear up a lot of acne, IF YOU STICK IT OUT AND USE A WHOLE JAR! Don’t expect results after 5 days. Rome wasn’t built in a day. Plus, using all 60 pads ensures that the acne “flare-up” isn’t due to natural bodily cycles. Good luck\n",

If you feel super dry after using this, just use a thin layer of hydrating moisturizer. Too much moisturizer will clog your pores. I have very acne prone skin and this is the only product that keeps my skin clear Honestly this is the only product that has cleared my skin up. I’ve tried a ton of things but after one night of using this my skin cleared to so much and I have bumps on my lower cheeks and it smoothed it all out my favorite product right now Best thing ever made i swear. It has cleared up my skin to the point where I don’t have to worry about breakouts. I only worry when I have no more of this product left lol! You won’t regret it. It has a strong smell, reminds me of rubbing alcohol, but it definitely does the job. Amazing product, a little bit drying though. It got rid of all my hormonal acne and prevented more from coming out! This product is nothing less than amazing! I have had issues with bad breakouts on my jaw and cheek, and have tried everything but nothing worked. That was until I tried this amazing product! Applied it before bed and could already see a big difference the next morning. I have now used it for 5 days and my skin looks so much better. Ordered these after I saw so many people raving about them, and I love them too. These are strong and will sting your skin especially if applying directly on acne. The smell is strong too, but not unpleasant. Even after washing my face these pull out so much additional dirt/oils because the pad always has something on it after I wipe. This is my skin's holy grail. It helps me during my worst times. Worth the price. Works...very well. I combine tea tree oil, these pads, tretinoin, hydroquinone, and M-61 hyrdoboost. This addition to my beauty regimen has had a pronounced effect on my wrinkles. FYI,stress and hormones forced me to become a beauty expert. These are incredible! I wanted something to help combat acne around my neck and jawline, but without having to put creams all over my face. These are perfect. Yes they are intense, but I don’t use them every day and I always apply a calming facial oil and good night cream afterwards. Will definitely be reordering when I run out! Didn’t reduce risk of new acne, but great for treating existing acne and helped to reduce scars. I have cystic acne on my cheeks and chin that developed post partum. I thought these were a great treatment for my form of acne. Non-drying too! If you are suffering from acne, this has been a lifesaver. It does cause a little dryness and flaking but nothing a good lotion cannot fix. My 15 year old son uses these and it’s really helped his acne. Obsessed! You can honestly feel this product cleaning your skin. Even though the scent can be a little overwhelming — cloyingly sweet, yet pungent like drugstore acne pads — I swear by this product. It’s a great post-cleanser “silver bullet” to prevent breakouts, used as a substitute for my oil control toner. The concentration is mild enough that I don’t feel a burn and the pads are soft enough that they don’t feel abrasive. these pore strips are so cool. i leave them on overnight and i'm both amazed and disgusted by the amount of oil on them in the morning, but they're so effective!! i wish they weren't so expensive but i love that they're different than \"traditional\" pore strips. definitely love treating myself to a pack of these every few months! Never written a review before, but I feel like I have a duty to mankind to hype these. I do not have acne. I have never had acne. But as I age (lol-I'm 24) and I work out more, I notice my pores are more visible and my dead skin builds up. It took me a year and half to find a solution. They pull all the gunk out of your skin and more. The first time I wore one, I realized that what I thought were air bubbles were just excess sh**t being sucked out by the hydro-colloid medium. If you really want to gag, peel off the strip once you hold it up to the light. I went to get a hydrafacial after using these for a few weeks, and the technician told me almost nothing came out of my skin. She told me my skin was like butter. Witchcraft, or just a really good product? You decide. Pro tip: sleep in these for maximum absorption.\n",

I leave on over night and I can see results! Leaves sticky feeling after however so I recommend washing your face after you remove the strip. Ok, so these are great... BUT.... for me personally they did not remove anything from my pores. What they did do was soften up all the crusty, clogged pores. Once I noticed this, I went in with my black head remover tool and was able to clean out pores that had been clogged since I can’t remember when. Do they work? Yes. Will I buy them again? Yes. I honestly love this product and this company. Everything they make is gold. I have always fought with blackheads on my nose and with using these strips they are almost gone! A must buy! My daughter suffers from moderate acne and these strips are a godsend. She loves how they suck all the gunk out of her acne and makes them flatter and less red. We have tried other brands but nothing compares to Peace Out! I have been using these strips for a year. They are the only product that clear my pores and help my acne. This product is a game changer! I totally swear by it, I thought was just hype but I tried it 3-4 times and the result amazes me every time. Work great!!! Just wish there was an option to purchase a larger amount in one box. I have sensitive skin and this does not cause any breakouts or irritation for me!!! I have been using the Luna oil forever, but with a move to a new city in a valley (so all the pollution), I noticed that I had congested bumps along my jaw line and nothing would get rid of it. After getting one of those free facials (with purchases over $75 in store), the lovely employee recommended I combine the glycolic sephora pads (every now and then) with this serum. And, bumps are pretty much gone!! I was amazed. I've never seen these results so quickly. Highly recommend.\n",

The size of the scar literally is SHRINKING AND LIGHTENING. This serum is magical I tell you! I bought it for $45 when sephora was having a sale on it, but I would rebuy it again at full price.

When I have run out of it or forgot to use, you definitely notice and see that my skin isn’t as nice. Although I’ve tried other serums, I seem to keep coming back to this one. It reduces blemishes from any gnarly zits and helps even out uneven pigmentation (like the gross sun spots I’ve got from years of tanning abuse- stay away from the subbed kids!). It even helps stop a zit in its tracks, if I catch it soon enough. Not at all greasy and while I mostly use it at night it’s light enough for day wear. Amazing! It visibly lower the pigmentation and make your skin look much healthier. Also removes redness and make a tone even. I have only been using this for 2 weeks and I am already in love with this product. I have really oily skin and a acne scars bc I can’t help but pick at my face. Within the first couple of uses I noticed my skin was smoother and brighter. After 2 weeks my skin is looking better than it ever has before. The o let down side is it does make my skin dry around my nose a little, other thank that it’s amazing!

I love this serum, it really does make my skin radiant! one of the only face products that i actually keep buying again and again! i have EXTREMELY dry skin and this is a HOLY GRAIL!!! keeps my skin moisturized under my foundation all day. just make sure its soaked into your skin well (if not it will break up your foundation) I love this stuff! A little goes a long way. .Overall my skin feels more hydrated with it. I can mix it with any other serums or my makeup and everything blend's easier. It really does give my skin a nice glow. I haven't noticed anything about a fine lines or wrinkles yet, I haven't been using it long enough for that. Overall I really enjoy how hydrating this product is. Love this product! Use it as my everyday face oil, especially in the winter. It is amazing! Im a 23 yr old guy, had acne for about 5 years tried masks from body shop but never worked. Finally got this and it cured my skin. Leviticus chapter 14 verse 5 in the bible also inspired me to get this Fresh Clay mask. Read or google it and you'll see what i mean! Love. I’ve tried just about all of the trendy favs and this is the one I continue to buy. Works great as a weekly mask! By far one of my favourite masks! Used it a few times on my whole face but mostly use as a spot treatment or just in my T-zone, always great results. Definitely worth the price!! Love it!!! Great to use as spot treatment or full face mask. Sometimes I used it just on the nose to clear blackheads and it works wonderfully as a weekly maintenance to rid of those pesky blackheads. My daughter loves this product. We got two samples from Sephora and she saw a difference on the first day and even more of a difference on the second. It does exactly what its suppose to do. It goes deep in to the pores and pulls the blackheads out. The price is kind of steep but its worth it...that's why I bought it. I have 2 areas around my face w a lot of black heads acne scars etc the first time I used this mask all of those 2 areas completely cleared up make sure not to not be in clothes u care about while using this mask bc stains are hard to get rid of but other than that so far I’ve loved this product This face mask helps to get rid of my pimples almost immediately after using it. It’s really good for reducing oil without drying out my skin. The mask dries really quickly and comes off easily, also works really well for spot treatments!! I have oily ance-prone skin, and this mask is amazing! It feels really good on and leaves my skin super soft. You can see it getting into the pores and clearing them. My acne has improved significantly just using this a couple nights a week. You also don't need to use a super thick amount of it, so the large jar lasts a very long time. OK! I just tried this mask for the first time and WOW. I decided to try it based off of reading the reviews, (I use to get the Rose face mask) but, wow. I am so in love with this face mask already. Definitely a must from this day forward! I have SUPER sensitive skin! I use this mask 1-2 times a week, and it works magic on my breakouts and just deep cleaning my face! I also use it as a spot treatment on my acne. Highly recommend it!! I love using this as a mask because I have issues all over. You really can see everything that it pulls out. It's a great product! I struggle with cystic acne and have tried everything, including salicylic acid which made my skin worse. This mask is incredible! I’ve only used it about 4-5 times and it’s gotten rid of my pimples and even helped with scaring. It’s worth the money! It’s also gentle on your skin. Highly recommend! So I Want To Start Off By Saying I Don’t Usually Write Reviews On Anything I Buy From Sephora But This Product Is A Must Buy. My Reason Is Because When I First Used This Mask, I Notice That Everything That Was In My Pores Of My Nose Actually Came Out And I Was Shocked. Many Times I Would Use Pores Strips To Try To Get Out Whatever In My Pores Of My Nose But This Product Is Truly Amazing!!!! I Will Truly Will Be Buying The Big Size Of This. Also If You Have Big Pores Around Or On Your Nose, Trust Me You Will See Everything That Was In It.\n",

It takes my problem areas and breakouts and makes them worlds better in just a matter of minutes! One of the best purifying masks I've ever used! It, along with some other skincare products, helped me reduce whiteheads that had been bothering me for a while. After trying many products that claim to reduce whiteheads but didn't work on me, I went in to a store and asked a Sephora employee for any recommendations. The first thing he recommended was this mask. Then, he also asked another associate if there's anything she would recommend. The first thing she mentioned was also this mask. So, naturally I just had to give it a try. And, I'm glad I did! I could see results just after one or two tries! I'll definitely repurchase.\n",
      "…read more I have been using this product for well over three years, and by far it is one of my favourite face masks I have ever used. I use this after using the Umbrian clay facial scrub and they are phenomenal together. The reason I really like this particular face mask is because not only does it make my skin feel softer and definitely refreshed but every time I use it I can visibly see the results of my skin looking better. It looks smoother, brighter and almost as though my skin has been airbrushed. I have tried a couple of other pore purifying masks - both drugstore brands but also other brands that Sephora carries - and yes a lot of them also make my skin feel very similar BUT the visible appearance of my skin following is nothing compared to using this mask. It is definitely worth a purchase and even though it is a bit pricey it might be best to try out the smaller size to see how it work for each individual. I have tried those mask on a few of my friends that have problem skin because they have enlarged pores and get acne breakouts and they have had phenomenal results as well. I think it is definitely worth the purchase if you’re overwhelmed with multiple options. It also had a light and refreshing natural scent, when I use it, it reminds me of having a great facial at a spa.\n",
      "…read more To be clear, I am an overall fan of Sunday Riley. I really like most products in this line, and this oil is no different. What I like most about Juno is it is an everyday oil. It’s an oil I can use on top of Retin A if my skin is feeling finicky at night, or I can use it alone under foundation during the day. It plays well with other product lines, like Obagi New-Derm, or as I stated can be used alone if I am trying to quickly get out the door or having an uncomplicated, minimal product day. It’s a good oil to have on hand.\n",
      "…read more This is my holy grail face oil. I've been using Juno for over a year and a half and I will never use another oil. Makes my skin look and feel great - I've never gotten so many compliments! I'm not even wearing foundation anymore, my skin looks that good. Try it, if it works for you, spend the $$ over and over! I have extremely dry skin, but break out real easily. I’ve been using Juno as a base moisturizer for about two years now, and have no intentions of changing. It can be greasy if too much is applied. I use 3 drops per application. 1 on my forehead and 1 in each cheek. A little goes a long way! If you could see all of my purchases you would know I have a bit of a beauty problem. That being said- this is my favorite oil- hands down. It has a light cranberry sort of scent and sinks in quickly. A little goes a long way and it really soothes and brightens my skin. I highly recommend for people who have combination skin because it doesn’t dry me out, doesn’t cause breakouts, and I don’t walk around looking like a greaseball.\n",
      "…read more I have very dry skin and this oil helped me a lot. Will definitely purchase it again. I have quite dry, sensitive skin, and while this oil does sit on top of my skin a bit, it also keeps my face from feeling like it's going to crack. I tried the Saint Jane Beauty serum around the same time as this Juno oil and found that they worked identically for my dry skin, but Juno is half the price! I have very dry skin, that’s is subject to hormonal break outs. I’ve used oils from Fresh, Drunk Elephant and a few other high end brands. This one is my favorite. I originally purchased the $40 bottle but when it ran out, I got the larger size. I use it in the morning, with Good Genes and Ice. It absorbs well, never sticky. I rub it on my cuticles... I slap it on my boys also. If I am doing a mask such as mixing ceramic slip + good genes, Charlotte Tilary, Drunk Elephant Baby Facial or Glam Glow, I use Juno afterwards and my skin is radiant. This oil comes in very handy for me, especially during the colder months.\n",
      "…read more It's an early call, but I think this is my favorite oil from Sunday Riley. (I have and use Luna and CEO when needed as well.) After just a few uses, my face feels so soft and smooth. This really gave my skincare routine a boost! I'm doing theatre and my skin gets really dry from having to scrub off the grease paint and the stage lights don't help. This makes my skin feel so much better! This is the best facial oil I’ve used so far, I use this morning and night, I have dry skin and I use them after moisturizer, 2-3 drops rub it in the palms of hands, goes a long way. This oil absorbs really well into my skin without feeling greasy, i also use 2 drops in the AM it gives a healthy glow to my skin during the day. The only thing I don’t like is the smell, it has a strong olive smell but it goes away after you apply it on. I’ve used DE marula oil, it was also very moisturizing but I prefer Juno.\n",
      "…read more Nice, lightweight oil. My tween can use this without breakouts & my skin feels naked without it. I use this everyday. My go to serum. This product is less ‘exciting’ than some as it doesn’t have any noticeable smell and the texture is very liquidy (not oil like or rich.) Long term use has resulted in clear, bright, even skin tone for me. Seems to just help with everything - fine lines, wrinkles, acne (even those under the skin pests!) I notice a decline in my skin condition when I stop using it so keep going back. Highly recommend. I tried a deluxe sample of this serum a few years ago and got so many compliments on my skin that I bought it full size and have restocked many times since! It makes my skin bright, hydrated, and clear. It’s great for jade rolling, too. This serum is everything I’m looking for! Amazing with helping with uneven tone, texture, acne scars and dullness. It absorbs quickly and is lightweight. This bottle lasts a long time so definitely worth the price. Whenever I sample another serum to maybe switch it up I always regret it and end up coming back to this one. made my skin glow and all my friends/ family were commenting on how healthy and bright my skin looked. 12/10 recommended, well worth the price. I had been getting eczema flare up on my eyelids and extreme dryness from overuse of eyeshadow primers. This product helped to reset my skin and get rid of the crepe, dry, and darkened look around my eyelids. It changed my life as I don’t need to apply hydrocortisone creams whenever I have irritation around my eyes. Highly recommend this for anyone with eyelid eczema. Use sparingly, the product will last a long time and you’ll notice you can stop using it as frequently!\n",

My skin looks more bright and well taken care of. Doesn't give me any sensitivity. It's just great and it is definitely worth the price. Awesome product. I can see a real difference in my skin. Discolorations are gone, gone, gone! This product is amazing. I had a breakout last year and of course it left my face lots of dark purple scars from the acne. I tried this one and can see the difference right after one use. I have keep using it over few months and everyone around me can see the change clearly. It works pretty well to brighten my skin and scars as well as keep my skin away from acne. This product saves my life. Be patient and keep using it, you will see the difference.\n",

It also doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky like some other products which, to me, is a sign that my skin is soaking it all up! This serum doesnt have pleasant smell, kinda like medicine, but that doesnt bother me. After the first week of using this serum, i can see my acne scars are faded a bit, my skin also smoother a bit from tiny acnes and blackheads, too. If you have conditions like me, this serum is a good choice. The important thing is, if you use (or not use) this serum in the morning skincare routine, always remember to put on suncreen, otherwise you might get sunburn. After all, this serum has acid in it, so becareful ladies!\n",

I see an overnight difference every time I use it. It also helps me with break outs, which is amazing. I can’t speak to the fine lines/wrinkles, but I hope I’m helping keep them at bay with this! I'm not even sure where to start! I originally purchased the DDG set with 14 peels and a small bottle of this serum. That set made me singlehandedly switch over nearly ALL of my skincare to DDG! I am about a month and a week into using this serum both morning and night. I have oily, acne prone skin, most of my breakouts are hormonal, with very large pores. You WILL NOT see immediate results. As a matter of fact, 2 weeks in, I started purging and breaking out pretty bad. I know retinol is not an ingredient used for the short term...so I just kept using the serum. I am SO GLAD I did! Things have cleared up. I wake up with smooth, even skin, I am not nearly as oily during the day, plus, bonus, my forehead wrinkles are no longer noticeable! I purchase the 2 oz bottle because it just makes sense when used day and night. I urge you to try this product for a minimum of two months, then assess your progress. I plan to use this serum for the year. Lightweight and absorbs quickly without residue. An oily girls best friend!\n",

I love it! Only been using for a week and has already drastically improved my skin more than anything else I’ve tried. It’s expensive but for the results I’ve had I’d say it’s worth it I was asked if I found the fountain of youth. This serum got rid of my ruddiness, redness, evened out my skin tone and smoothed out fine lines. It brightens your skin and really makes it glow! I never write reviews, but this is worthy of a review. It’s magic sauce for my skin type. It’s so good that I need to write a good review on this product. I used their red bottle serum as well. This one gives huge help with my skin. Skin tone gets even now, so smooth. And the little bump under the center of my lower lip, it’s the most annoying place, because my face is pretty smooth. But I can always feel there little bumps, like enlarge hair pore under there. But it’s almost gone and getting smoother now. I will highly recommend this product\n",

It’s super gentle for something that corrects uneven skin tones and great for sensitive skin! The price may seem very high for this product but you really are paying for quality product, and I normally don’t buy over 200 serums but this one is amazing! After keeping using it for 3 months, I can see some changes and improvements. It can not let your skin be whiter than your whitest part of the body. But it can brighten your face gradually. Very nice product but expensive. I am in my late 20s and have non-sensitive combination skin. I got this product to prevent the formation of dark spots. I used Shiseido whitening line for years. This product is more aggressive than Shiseido whitening serum, which means you can see a huge difference within just one week! It doesn't cause any irritation for me. If you are concerned about ingredients, this product may not be suitable for sensitive skin. In addition, this product might cause the feeling of dryness so that you should use cream or lotion after using it.\n",

I have incredibly oily skin so I skip the serum in the summer and use only the Essence but I use this serum every day in the winter. As soon as you apply it a slightly shiny sheen appears, your skin actually glows a bit and without makeup my face does look a little oily but as soon as I apply my BB cream my face looks really good. It certainly works but my suggestion is to apply it as needed based on your skin type.\n",

I have combination skin that is acne prone and prone to redness and has hyperpigmentation from acne scars. Ever since I started using this, it has evened my skin tone out so much and my skin has never looked so radiant. It seems my skins tendency for redness is diminished too. The price is steep but i don’t even use a full dropper of product to cover my face and would expect the bottle to last at least 6 months. I was confused and thought this was an essence, but it is definitely a serum. For all the k-beauty addicts, I definitely suggest using a snail cream with it. :)\n",

I would slather it all over if I could since it also smells wonderful. I love this essence. My face is brighter and smoother than it used to be. all the people around me compliment me that my skin looks really good. Definitely continue buying this one This is the most effective brightening product I have ever used. I have tried a lot... Even though it is expensive, but try it! You will see the difference. This is a fantastic, no-fuss hydrating serum. It gets the job done and makes my moisturizer work better. Love it! I love this stuff. My skin breaks out when it's dry and this has been a big help. You guys!!!! This has OFFICALLY turned into my holy grail product!!!!! I know I’ve only been using this for about a week but ohhhh bot had this made my skin look bomb.com!!!! I will tell you the texture as first is a bit weird ( my first reaction was on how this was a serum did to the texture) and it feels a bit tacky after applying it but it goes away once I add my oil and moisturizer in my daily routine. I live in the desert and constantly battle dry skin, especially in the winter. I occasionally suffer from eczema around the sides of my nose, but this serum helps keep it under control. I use the FAB Hydrating Serum both in the morning and night to keep my skin hydrated and also to act as a vehicle for any treatment serum I apply. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has dry, sensitive skin in need of a drink of water. It leaves my skin dewy and plump without feeling sticky. Thank you, FAB!\n",

Leave my skin supple, with tons of bounce. I love First Aid Beauty! This will forever be a staple in my skincare routine. Hydrates my sensitive skin with no irritation! I apply before moisturizing am and pm. I have classic combination skin. Oily around my nose and chin, but my cheeks and forehead get super dry. I've always used moisturizing creams (including some recommended to me by a dermatologist nurse), but I would still be dry and peeling a bit while my chin became overly oily. The sephora rep put this on my skin during a Perk mini-facial and it's been amazing. No peeling and I don't feel oily at all. I put it on after washing my face and then either put normal SPF moisturizer on top (morning) or my overnight cream (night). My skin has been amazing. As noted, the bottle lasts about a month, which does make it a bit pricier than your normal OTC moisturizer, but I'm happy paying for amazing, hydrated skin. Recommended to my best friend and she had similar results. We both don't spend a lot of makeup or face products, but this is worth EVERY PENNY. Recently ran out on a trip (because my sister loves it and kept stealing it) and after just a week of not using it, I'm dried out and peeling. Just got back to town today and running FAST to Sephora to get more. Moral of the story - always have an extra on hand.\n",

When I use products, I usually have to use them religiously so that I get the full effect-with a lot of creams, and serums leaving my skin absolutely dull and not helping at all, but this product is a God-send. It locks in moisture and repairs my skin, just like it says it will. I usually use the toner first, then this, then my moisturizer. All first aid beauty because it's the first brand that actually keeps my skin from drying out, especially during the winter months. I love, love, love this product. I recommend it. Sometimes though, it can leave a tackiness to my skin that'll usually go away once I put my moisturizer over it. I think the tackiness primarily comes from when I put too much product in one place so my skin doesn't absorb it all. You don't really need the full pump unless you have a giant face–which I don't, I just half-awake put it onto my face and remember afterwards that I put WAY too much onto my face.\n",

I do double cleanse, exfoliate (not everyday), toner, essence, serum, treatment, face mask (not everyday), eye cream, face cream, moisturizer, sun protection. So it’s an all around care. The tatcha deep hydration serum is a fantastic addition to my skin care routine. It’s light, easily absorbed, and a little goes A LONG WAY. I only use a pearl size portion and it covers my whole face... so if you think it’s sticky, try applying less of it.

Beautiful serum to use after using the essence. It has good “slip” and one pump is all you need. My skin has never been better since using Tatcha. Wish I would’ve discovered this line sooner. I will never live without this serum again. In the summer, it's the first thing I put on after washing my face, followed by sunscreen, and I'm done with moisturizing. This provides deep hydration without oiliness and has calmed down my easily irritated skin. It goes on smoothly, isn't sticky, and smells good. The price tag has been worth it for me. In the winter, I use this as my first layer as well, but also put a moisturizer before sunscreen because I need a little more hydration. Regardless of the season, this is a daily staple for me.

Occasionally I get a serious hormonal break out all along my jaw line of small pimples that are more like bumps because they never come to a head, and this makes them vanish over night. I really couldn’t believe it as I’ve struggled with skin issues since being a teen. I would recommend anyone with stubborn acne give this a try. Will buy again. It does dry my skin out, but it’s well worth the money in my opinion.\n",
      "…read more I can always count on this miracle goop to fix my acne if it ever pops up! My skin can be super dry and sensitive, but this is gentle enough to put on acne even if it’s in larger patches on my cheeks, nose, forehead, or chin and I’ve never had patchiness or dried out flakes because of it! I’ve used so many different spot treatments and this is my favourite. I’ve only had to use one in a whole year, but I bought it right away again after, it’s so effective.\n",
      "…read more This stuff is a must have! Seriously has saved my skin! I get hormonal acne, cystic acne, tiny bumps etc. and this will fix whatever flare up within a day or two! It is thin so it smooths over skin nicely and does not affect make up application or anything! Used it on my 14yr old son. Noticed his acne was going away little by little. But I see a big difference now. This is the best acne spot treatment. I've tried multiple products from The body shop, Kate, some Korean brands, but none of them fits me so well like this. Highly recommended. Don't remember how many of them I bought and used. No demand to try others. This stuff is magic. I have light acne scarring and usually have 2-5 trouble spots on my face. I began using this four days ago and I noticed results the first morning after I applied it. pimples? gone. I’m ordering more tubes now! one of the best overnight spot treatments I've ever used. Not too irritating on my sensitive skin, but paired with the rest of my skincare routine it works very well to clear up acne in 2-3 days I use this every time I feel a pimple coming in and it works wonders. Best fast acting acne relief product I’ve ever tried. I recommend 100%. At first I didn’t think this product was working at all, until I was about a week into using this nightly. I noticed no new pimples. I’m now in my second week of using this product and I’ve noticed a huge difference in my skin. I would highly recommend. I get it it is very expensive but it does works. Sadly for me im not using as much make up as I used to, so I been using this alone as a sun screen, it doesn’t make my fave greasy. One thing do I noticed the product is getting murky but still works Non greasy, blurs and doesn't clog pores, and acts as a great primer. Holy grail. AMAZING!!! I used this sunscreen alone, with no make up. It made my face look like I had spent hours putting on make up and my skin looked flawless. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants a primer and sunscreen in one. Love the velvet feel. Just glides on. A little amount goes a long way and I don’t have to worry about sunscreen. I have super sensitive eczema skin and this produce does not irritate my skin. buy it! it’s my all in one skin perfecter. it blurs my skin and leaves me looking poreless... the days i don’t wear makeup my skin looks smooth. the days i wear makeup, it doesn’t move, crack, crease, anything. love the invisible spf too, no flashback. must have. I use this as a primer for my makeup. I love it. It has a sunscreen, SPF 30. It goes on so easily. It looks good even without makeup. Add a little powder and then great look. Makes my pores look smaller. Does just what it says. It blurs your imperfections. I love this! It works just like it says it does for my skin! Just purchased my second bottle! I absolutely love this sunscreen. I will never use anything else (and I have tried them all!) I love that it doesn't leave me looking like a white ghost. It goes on super smooth and a little goes a long way. It lasts for a looooong time; I still reapply mid-day, but I can tell it's still on from the morning. I know the price seems a little high, but one bottle lasts me 6-7, and sometimes 8 months. I don't skimp when it comes to sunscreen, so this is a huge money-saver for me. I saw a few others that said this wasn't going on smooth- that happens at the start of every bottle but only for the first several uses. I just use a little extra and keep smoothing until it blends. Also, I've found that some cleansers can cause this to \"ball up\" as well. I ditched those cleansers and haven't had a problem since. The icing on the cake.... this makes your pores just disappear and really helps to make your skin tone look lovely. I've been able to cut back on makeup and just use this- compliments all the time!\n",

This product is just awesome! I’ve been using another Retinol brand which was more expensive than this one and gave me fairly good results. This one is different! It gets absorbed right away and never leaves a greasy layer, it’s really as if I’m watering my face! It instantly feels supple & hydrated with zero irritation and no tons of dead skin on my face in the morning. I’ve been only using it for 2 weeks but I can tell my face is getting more radiant & hydrated than ever. Can’t wait to see the results a few months from now! Highly recommended :)\n",

I have fair skin with lots of what I thought were freckles...but really they only come out in the summer...and then kind of hang around albeit a little lightened. This product drastically removed those “freckles” and now I realize that’s just sub damage! So I make sure to put on lots of sunblock and what a difference. I’ve only been using it every night for the last two weeks and it’s amazing! No irritation or anything. I’m 39 and my 72 year old neighbor told me about this and she’s got perfect skin!\n",

It is a holy grail, I use it 2-3x a week and it is a holy grail. Definitely worth a try. I used to use a prescription retinol but switched over to this a few months ago just for the convenience of picking it up in store. I love it! The product works, it is not heavy on the skin. It absorbs right away with no greasy feeling and my skin looks refreshed when I wake up in the morning. Best retinol ever! At first I didn't think I was going to like this product. Second I didn't understand the hype over retinol. I decided to splurge and give this product a shot and I'm so happy I did.This is my second bottle and my first one lasted me over a year so I think you really get your moneys worth with the amount that you get. You don't need a lot just 4-5 drops was enough but oh boy is it powerful! I noticed that my skin started clearing and became brighter. I would even say it brought a youthful glow to my skin. I've recommended this product to a lot of my friends and they all agree that it has changed their skin for the better!\n",
      "…read more First night used it no issues. Went in easy - no detectable smell. I skipped the second night because my skin slightly started flaking. Then I used it two nights in a row. My boyfriend, who has no idea what goes into my skincare regime (or that I was trying something new) actually commented (out if the blue!) on how supple my skin looked. What!?! Ok. Sold ! LOVE. My sensitive skin loves this serum and it’s really helped with fine lines and moisture . Absolutely in love with this product!! Ok, so I was looking for a Retinol product that would help with very little, thin, fine lines under the eyes and to even out my skin tone. This stuff is IT! I found what I was looking for! The bottle it comes in is very easy to use. I take the dropper and just put a few drops on my face and rub it all over with my hands. I have normal to dry skin and I use this every night and just wash my face in the morning. It hasn’t broken me out or irritated my skin. I was amazed at how fast this stuff works, I kid you not that I saw results after ONE time of using it. It gave me smooth, soft and hydrated skin. My face looked amazing. Now I don’t suffer from acne, never have so I can’t comment on whether it helps that. It does help the fine lines and if you have uneven skin tone it helps so much. If you have any little rough spots on your face, this stuff smooths it out A LOT! I can’t say enough about this product. It is pricey but it’s worth every penny. Do yourself a favor and just try it out! If it doesn’t work for you, you can always return it. But if it does? You’ll LOVE it too!\n",

A helluva lot. And if you have sensitive skin you just found the holy grail. Cleared up my recurring adult hormonal acne within one week. I’ve been using only in the AM as the first step in my skincare routine. This will be a staple in my routine go forward. My daughter had acne on her forehead and temples, occasionally her cheeks. No other OTC treatment works like this stuff! She almost never has a single spot if she uses this every night. When we ran out (and Sephora was out of stock) her acne came back with a vengeance. We finally got our bottle about a week ago and her skin is already clearing up with no new spots. This is our holy grail to get her through the skin struggles of puberty!\n",
      "…read more It actually works. I use it at night only otherwise it is too drying. It is still pretty drying even using every night but it cleared up my small little forehead zits really well. This is the best product I’ve found that works for my skin. I’m afraid it will go extinct because I can go for periods being unable to catch it in stock. KS products are solid, not trendy. They work so well. Happy to see it was back in stock after a long hiatus on Sephora. I know that my skin usually responds well to Benzoyl Peroxide products, but I've been having a prolonged chin breakout for almost three months. My usual favorites, Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask and Paula's Choice Extra Strength Daily Skin Clearing Treatment, hadn't been able to keep up. My skin was becoming irritated and much more likely to flake/peel then it ever had. Enter: Kate Somerville. The product has excellent slip, I feel like it's effective with minimal application, and it delivers the results of Benzoyl Peroxide with actual hydration and virtually no irritation. I applied it only to my problem areas for about five days and the appearance change was dramatic. I still had a few small clogs along my jaw line, but nothing like I had been dealing with. Since then, I've treated my forming zits by double cleansing, applying blue light therapy, and finishing with a tiny dab of Anti Bac. And in conjunction with finding good, lightweight moisturizers, I've kept all but the really hormonal acne at bay for months! Super love it. Usage notes: only to apply to affected areas, spot treating if possible. Remember to use sunscreen as this can sensitize skin slightly. Also, I probably wouldn't use if I didn't have results from benzoyl peroxide in the past.\n",
      "…read more Best acne lotion ever !!! The only one that can help me with my cystic acne!! Love it I have combo to oily skin with occasional breakouts/hormonal acne. This stuff is the best! It controls my skin like no other. I know the price is a bit steep, but it’s worth every penny to me. I apply a thin layer every night after my cleanser and toner. Will keep coming back for this product over and over again! SO impressed w this stuff. I don't have acne but I have blackheads on my nose. It definitely clears them up! Word of caution- I can't use daily because it'll make my skin break out. But every other day seems to do the trick. Just listen to your skin! But srsly get this if you're having issues w blackheads. I don’t normally write reviews but holy cow you guys. This stuff is amazing. I have oily/acne prone/sensitive skin and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all and actually helps regulate my oil production as well. It doesn’t overly dry my face either which is a huge plus. I’m so sad that it’s out of stock literally everywhere right now because my face is crying a little bit...BUT it is 100% worth the purchase. I use 1-1 1/2 pumps for my whole face and down under my chin as well even though I don’t have any acne down there. This stuff is a miracle!!\n",

After one week of using this lotion twice daily, all of the bumps on my forehead cleared. And when I had an autoimmune flare up, it prevented another breakout! I have been searching for so long for a solution to my break outs. It did not dry my skin out either, even when applying 3 times a day. The Anti Bac Clearing Lotion has been a huge confidence booster!\n",
      "…read more My dermatologist recently retired so I purchased this to quickly replace a prescription benzyl peroxide gel. I had a large zit on my cheek as I started to use this. I remembered reading a review mentioning a \"purging\" phase as my one zit turned into 8 on the same cheek!! I toughed it out for 3 weeks before seeing a decrease in white heads and cysts. The black heads on my nose were easily tamed in one week. After showering, I wet a corner of my towel with HOT water and press it on any painful zits. I think this helps soften my skin and allows for better absorption.\n",
      "…read more I've repurchased this gem multiple time along with a few other products that have left my skin almost poreless and so smooth with minimal acne. My forehead used to look like the Rocky mountains and as it cleared up I've experienced less and less break outs. This product combined with others is my holy grail. My favorite bp product. This lotion helps cleared out my mild facial acne. Initially, I did have a minor purge, but after a week, I started to notice improvement. It had been a month of using this, and I have the best skin of my life yet (70% clearer). Although it helps prevent new pimples from popping up, the lotion won’t help cure present acne though. This is the first product that cleared up hormonal chin acne after 6 months of salicylic acid, glycolic, retin-a, niacinamide and clindamycin. I just wish I had used it before my wedding! Thank you Kate Somerville. This lotion is fantastic. I started seeing reduced breakouts on my chin within two weeks. Not too drying even with two applications per day, which is important in an acne medication. A new everyday product. I have oily/combo skin that is prone to breakouts once a month or when I accidentally sleep with my makeup on (oops). When I do find that my skin is breaking out, I use this lotion before my moisturizer in the morning and find that it helps clear my skin faster than just waiting for my breakouts to subside on their own. It works great under all my skincare and makeup products and is easy to use before my morning makeup routine. It will dry out your skin if you use it daily for a few days but just make sure to keep your skin hydrated throughout the day to avoid flaky skin. Overall, I recommend this as a solution to help clear pesky breakouts in a shorter time span. It is easy to use and works great with other skin and makeup products so there's no worrying about products piling or this products' effectiveness.\n",

My skin looks fresher, more youthful, and firmer. The longer I use it, the better my skin looks! Must buy for dry winter skin. My skin went from being so dry that all fine lines were visible to being hydrated and plump in under two weeks! I love this product for winter Works great. Very hydrating. Would re purchase. Was suggested by Sephora employee. I love Josie Maran products and the pure argan milk is wonderful! I use it when I have dry areas on my face or acne, and areas of irritation. I also dab it around my eyes to help with fine lines. I notice a huge difference when I use this product and highly recommend it! Just use it sparingly since a tiny bit goes a very long way! The best, I’ve tried so many products and absolutely love argan milk I purchased this in hopes that it would help my skin out. I wasn’t sure what was going on with my skin. It was so dull, I can say I literally looked dehydrated. Applied this at night and the next morning... MY GOD! My face looked 100 times better! I was really amazed. My face felt plumped and soft and my skin tone was even. I WILL be buying this again! This product literally changed my skin in one use and I accidentally figured it out. I have combination skin and a VERY oily nose and chin. I was going to avoid those areas but just did it anyway and to my surprise my nose and chin have been not oily at all and my skin feels like a baby. Who knew? I’ll be purchasing the full size. I’m guessing this is better for combo/oily skin and that’s why it’s suspended in water? I don’t know but it changed my life! (None of my skin is extremely dry just for reference)\n",

How did I not use this before. I use it Morning and night and what a difference. I even think it makes my pores smaller. I live in a very dry climate so this just adds so much moisture but not to where I’m oily looking. It sinks right in. The dropper does suck like the rest of the comments say but the product is so great I don’t care. I love this mask. I have a lot of cystic acne, as well as other kinds of acne, and this mask helps decrease the bumps and gets rid of my acne faster. I also think it de-clogs my pores because I have noticed some gunk come out of my pore after use (not RIGHT after but maybe a day or two) which is A LOT better than that clogged pore turning into a pimple. I used GlamGlow charcoal mud mask before this one, and I think this one works a lot better. I use it on my whole face or spot treatment.

I used to have cystic acne on my jawline. I purchased it on Sep 4 and during this month I only had one tiny acne. BTW its spot brightener is really working. This mask ended my acne breakout that I have been dealing for a year. This is a must have for those suffering from acne. This truly works. I have been using it every other day for 10 minutes and it never dried my face. Of course to prevent drying of the skin, I use caudalie vinopure serum, sulwhasoo moisturizer and Sulwhasoo sleeping mask every night. My sister who was also dealing with acne bought this immediately when she saw the improvement in my face and she was so thankful for it.

Made a huge difference in my skin. I already use the cloud cream from the same line and this visibly improved the texture of my skin.

I have struggled with dry skin all my life and have tried most hyaluronic serums in the market but none had worked for me. This is the first product that really makes a difference in my aging dry skin. I’ve used it directly on my clean face before night moisturizer. It makes my face baby soft the next morning. I’ve also mixed it with my long wear foundation and it helps to keep it a little more hydrated. The routine that really works for me now is as follows: DHL face oil for cleaning, Clinique moisture surge lotion as toner, Dennis Gross hyaluronic marine hydration booster, Clinique Vitamin C serum, Biossance or FAB moisturizer, and Biossance squalene face oil. The texture of this serum is watery so I applied one drop onto one section of my face at a time.

I wouldn’t want to put makeup over it or anything else, but for this specific function it is an awesome product. My dry skin loves this!! My skin just feels more supple and hydrated when i use this. I've started using the Ordinary brand hyaluronic serum and it's not as good as this but it's 1/6th the price. When all the steps in your skin care routine are expensive, the ordinary is good to switch off with. Although, when i run out of that i will be splurging on this again! The product is slightly tacky and I would prefer more Hyaluronic acid and less of the other ingredients. But I'm on my 2nd bottle because it provides the right amount of moisturizer for my combination skin in both warm and cold weather. If I need more moisture I apply a second layer. The bottle and dropper are perfect for controlling the amount dispensed and keeps the product sanitary. I switched to this from Peter Thomas Roth's Hyaluronic serum because it came in a pump bottle and wasted so much product that it barely lasted 3 weeks. One bottle of this booster lasts about 3 months.\n",
      "…read more I got a microdermabrasion facial about a month ago and the esthetician recommended this product. After a months use I can completely see a difference in my skin. Clearer, smoother, and more subtle! Smells amazing too! Definitely recommend! This product is the best! I use it twice a day. It’s very light weight, water based so it layers well with whatever else you might use. The woman who does my facials asked what I started doing differently bc she noticed such a change in my skin for the better and said she’s going to buy it too. I have tried lots of different primers and setting sprays for oil control. This is the only primer that actually works for me. I usually apply makeup around 4:30 am, and by maybe 1:00 pm at the latest, I’m oily. But this primer has been on since 4:30 am and it’s now 4 pm and I’m still pretty much shine free. I have a very minimal amount of shine right now; nothing compared to the amount of shine I normally have. When I applied this primer, I could instantly feel the matte effect. I absolutely love it.\n",
      "…read more This primer truly minimizes pores!!! I absolutely love it❤️ Love this primer , it’s the best . It does dry off white but once u put on your foundation u can’t even tell Best mattifying primer, hands down. For all the people who horrifically in their used used milk of magnesia because all the other primers were playing around- this means business. Only use this if your skin is truly \"the real deal\" type of oily skin. This will keep you matte, essentially forever :-P I swear by this primer! No matter what foundation I used, no matter how matte it was, my T-zone would be shiny and oily by the end of the day. I apply this primer to my t-zone before I put on my foundation and my makeup stays matte all day!! It literally only takes a pea sized amount, just applied to your problem areas so a bottle lasts a long time. Definitely worth the price! I use this in my T zone and it just makes my makeup look so smooth and matte! I physically saw my pores blur and disappear when I put it on! Which is exactly what I wanted because I get oily so easy if I use liquid makeup! I love this! This stuff is amazing!!!! It keeps the oil and shine away all day WOW! How have I not used this primer sooner? It is like using Giorgio Armani’s Luminous Silk without any pigment. The texture is smooth and not gritty, and the results are so good, you might skip the foundation. I love it, this serum relieves the skin rash and lightens the spots on my face. My skin around my eyes and lips show the most change. I keep getting asked what I use. After almost a month of using this serum, my pores are tighter, my skin looks more plumped, and the redness of my skin has been diminished. I struggled with redness for Some time, mostly on my forehead and nose. I see a significant improvement in the overall health of my skin. This has become a staple product for me. I use it twice a day, let it sink into my skin for about 5 min and follow with moisturizer.\n",
      "…read more i needed a good serum and after reading the reviews, i decided to try this one. i am so happy i did! this stuff is amazing and after only using it a short time i have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and the size of my pores. this is a now a staple in my skincare regimen! highly recommend this product. This is a holy grail product in my skincare. I’ve repurchased it three times already and am preparing for a fourth round. I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to redness. This serum is so hydrating and makes my skin look even and plump and glowy. I haven’t found a serum to match it. The Sephora worker recommended this because my skin was so dry. I was hesitant based on the price in addition to my usual lotions. But it had honestly made a different in my skin. My skin feels much more hyrdrated. It isn’t as dry as it was before. I’ve been using it for about 2 months. I would buy again when I’m out. Love this product. I try a lot of products and this one is a winner. I was hesitant at first to buy due to the price but honestly totally worth! I had completely damaged my skin barrier and nothing really helped except this. Perfect for sensitive/reactive skin! Basically does what it promises and have repurchased it! Left my skin very moisturized and plump. LOVE this product, it is light weight and glides on. Also love that this is \"clean\" approved. this is my second bottle and will continue to use. I got this as a sample in a sephora play kit and went out and bought a full size because I absolutely loved it! My skin is dry and this stuff immediately hydrates, and makes my skin look more youthful. I also suffer from occasional redness and haven't had that issue at all since using this. I highly recommend!! im on my 5th bottle. Absolutely love this, it is a water serum, i put all over my face including my eyes. It makes my skin plump, glow, hydrated and smooth. first step after primer before additional serum or moisturizer Wow! I am blown away from this serum. I have acne prone skin and most serums breaks me out. I can only use Tatcha C serum. As I get older I knew that I need another serum to hydrate my skin, and I am so glad that the SA suggested this during my perk facial. Love it! It’s so light and the best part is that it doesn’t break me out. I have been using it for a week, and my skin definitely got more hydrated and glowing. My favorite daytime serum yet!!!\n",
      "…read more After seeing this posted on @chrissytiegen stories on Instagram of course I had to try! This is a great product that truly does help the texture of your skin. Love it! I love these pads so much. With my sensitive skin it is nice to have a product that makes such an impact without causing redness and irritation. I’ve already purchased my 2nd box! This is a great at home option if you’re looking for a way to save money in between spa visits I love this peel and use it faithfully 3 times a week it has the effect I desire and doesn’t dry my skin out. Absolutely LOVE these pads. I go over my face with it at night and wake up with smooth skin. It’s great for when I have a break out because it just “gets it out” and it’s ready to extract the day after. I’m obsessed with the smell too. Tip: half a pad is plenty! I cut mines in half and it lasts me longer. This product has made my 50-year old skin bounce back beautifully after a very dehydrating winter. After a week of using the wipes 2x/week, my skin is so much smoother and my makeup looks flawless without the need for heavy coverage or layers of primer. Im a skeptic about skincare products that promise transformation, but after finishing my first box, I’m convinced! The only criticism I have is in this advertisement. The photo supposedly shows a woman’s forehead “before” and then “after” 2 weeks of use. The problem is, this isn’t a daily use product. Are they suggesting we use it daily for rapid results, or that there’s a miracle transformation in this woman’s forehead after using just 2 to 4 wipes in 2 weeks time?\n",
      "…read more This product is honestly a god send. I’ve only used it three times so far and after the third use I woke up feeling like I was back in my early 20s ( I am presently 28 going on 29). Not only does this product brighten, but it evens out skin tone and feeling like a youth again. I have some hyperpigmentation left over from break outs here and there, and honestly after just three uses I can honestly say I notice a huge difference. Thank you Dr. Dennis Gross for making these wonderful, made- easy pads. Great product I’d recommend to people I know looking for evenness, brightness and a dose of youth.\n",
      "…read more One of the best peels ever made in my opinion. It’s gentle enough not to sting and you can see results immediately. I bought for myself and my mom whose skin has deep wrinkles and sun damage. It helps so much with clarity, break outs, texture. Make sure you swipe over face 2-3 times and do not rinse. Just apply serum and moisturizer. Also, I use as series-2 weeks every 6 months. I recieved a 3 pack sample of these in one of my subscription boxes, and I fell in love with them. Even after the first use. My HUSBAND, who wouldn't notice if I nest him to death with a flip flop, even said your skin looks great what did you do. I was sold. And still am. I swear by them, asked for some at Christmas, and will get a 2nd box at Tax Time. You girls know, that's when you buy the stuff you would otherwise have to sell a kidney to afford. This is so worth the money!\n",
      "…read more I received these in a Sephora Play box. They have a light smell but I didn’t find it unpleasant. The pad is a good size and is well-saturated (but not overly) with the product. The pad isn’t abrasive, and my skin felt nice after using. It felt a little tighter, didn’t irritate my skin, and it looked more radiant the next day! These are a little pricey but if you’re got the money to spend, I think they’d be worth it. One of my absolute favourite peels! I find the alpha beta line too strong for regular use but these are great. I see a difference the next day every time I use one. My skin just glows and looks so fresh and it really helps my pores look minimized. These peels are amazeballs!!! I use it after I do the 2-step Dr. Gross alpha beta peels, a total game changer! My skin looks so amazing the next day. I highly recommend it. They are a bit pricey but well worth the splurge. I received 2 samples in one of my play boxes. I read reviews online before using and they were amazing reviews! So I finally tried and ummmm it works!!! Now I only used once and the wrinkles in my forehead were close to gone the next morning. I do feel like they may be coming back, but only used it once. I would totally buy a full package of these. Hands down the best peel retinol pads on the market. They turn your skin from meh to yay in one night. You’re glowing and your sling feels smooth, the flaws erased. Dennis Gross is amazing. Though I’m not necessarily a fan of the daily peels (go ahead, you can judge me), these ones are amazing. I honestly didn’t want to love this because of the price tag, but after receiving a sample in my PLAY box a few months ago I had to buy the full size. I have combination skin that breaks out due to hormones. I use these pads twice per week along with the dr dennis gross extra strength daily peel twice per week (alternating days) and my skin is the best its ever been. Although I’m 24 and not necessarily too “wrinkly” yet per say, I live in a city where my skin is exposed to pollution daily and spent years without ever touching sunscreen to my face — my skin was starting to look congested, dull, and prematurely aging. These pads were a godsend! My skin is better looking than when I was in college. Its glowing, tight and refreshed looking for the first time, and I rarely break out if ever after two months of using these products. For those of you who like instant gratification, I noticed a huge difference when I woke up the very first time I tried this. My esthetician also highly recommended this brand.\n",
      "…read more The best peel pad ever used.It has done magic on my skin. I wanted to buy this product for a long time but didn’t because I thought my concealer and tea tree oil will do it. However, I bought it and it covers my pimples better than the concealer. Something I wasn’t expecting at all! It also removed my pimple in 1 day! It got to the point where I could press a warm towel on my skin to remove the pimple. Love this product and wished I bought it a long time ago This is the best colored spot treatment I have ever used and even saves me time from applying a spot treatment at home from working so well throughout the day. Application is easy, after washing and moisturizing I just pat and blend it out over my blemishes. By the end of the day, my blemishes come out as I remove it and cleanse my face at night. People noticed the difference in clarity it has provided me. I absolutely recommend this product as a former cosmetic retail employee.\n",
      "…read more It covers my blemishes with ease without making me look cakey!! This not only covers my blemishes but it also helps my skin I have seen much improvement ever since I started using this I honestly don’t understand all the bad reviews. This stuff works great for me. It’s buildable, it dries up my spots, and it dries down quickly unless you put it on too thickly, and it never makes my skin feel too tight. The Light is a little too dark for me (not terribly, as it disappears under my Bye Bye Foundation) so this time I’m ordering it in Fair. I don’t have horrible cystic acne, just a zit here or there. I think it probably wouldn’t be a huge help for cystic acne-that requires more intensive drugs than this-but I think it does a great job of helping my occasional breakouts heal up while covering them up.\n",
      "…read more I love this product. It blends very well and gives enough coverage without being heavy. Most days this is the face makeup I wear. I liked this product. It lasts a long time and even when it doesn't necessarily dry out pimples, it definitely prevents them from getting worse. I would purchase this again. Finally a concealer I love! I got this as a sample and the first time I used it my husband said I was glowing! We took pictures that day and I didn’t even need a filter lol So I purchased the full size immediately! I love this product so much that I don't even use foundation anymore. I don't have time to put full make up on nowadays and this product just save me from showing up to work like a zombie with dark spots. This concealer is definitely worth trying if you have breakout prone skin. It covers evenly and blends really well. This stuff is like my own genie in a bottle. I have fair skin and work in a veterinary clinic where the animal hair is constantly making me red and causing breakouts. I've noticed a tremendous difference in my skin quality since using this on those little red blemishes. Even my boyfriend has commented on how nice my skin looks now:) AMAZING product! Covers without making acne worse! the most amazing concealer ever. i have cystic acne and i’ve tried everything this covers it up without looking cakey and (in conjunction with my dermatologist prescribed medicines) has made a drastic different in my face texture and overall appearance. i highly recommend I really love La Mer products. I have extremely sensitive skin and have rosacea. This seems to really hydrate and calm my skin as well as diminish redness. I love it so far. I got a deluxe sample of this and have been using it twice a day for three weeks. Follow with Drunk Elephant B-Hydra serum in the morning and follow with La Mer moisturizing cream at night. Since adding this serum to my routine my skin looks and feels great. No more dry cheeks and tightness this winter. Fine lines are also gone. Have to bite the bullet and buy the full size. I’ve been trying to find a really good serum and this is by far the best one I’ve ever used. OK so I've gotta say this is the first La Mer product I bought. I got it as a gift to myself in my last year of my 20's and because I started to noticed some fine lines (noooooo bueno). I use it at night and I love the way my skin looks in the morning. In the summer months, I wear sunscreen during the day and this stuff at night. In the winter I wear this plus sunscreen and my skin sings. I have also noticed that it has decreased my fine lines. Worth the splurge, and honestly I use this every OTHER night and it does the trick to stretch it out for sure. TREAT YO'SELF!\n",
      "…read more I’ve been using this serum for over two years and although I’ve tried to find something cheaper I just can’t get away from this one. With super dry skin in the winter this serum gives the perfect boost of hydration I can’t go without it and in the summer i usually wear as my last step with no additional moisturizer needed. I use this serum religiously every morning, if nothing else, I would always apply this serum after my toner. I’m about to buy for the third time.\n",

Absorbs in a second and skin looks glowy and soft straight after. Perfect for winter since it locks moisture really well. My skin seems to need a lot of exfoliation & my complaint about most peels is that they don’t do enough. I know this one is worth the money because: Every day I use a scrub or chemical exfoliant, some days both. Even so, after awhile my skin looks dull & flaky & I need More. I’ve tried dozens of “peels” but only a couple were really helpful, & they were both discontinued. So with clogged shelves & lots of wasted $$$$$ (oops, I never get around to returns!) I was thinking I’d just have to go pro. But now I don’t. Finally one that works! I got it as a sample, tried it, went to buy it & it was temporarily sold out, which tells me other people loved it too ;) The day after I used it, my husband commented on how nice my skin looks. I would guess this would be too much for some people, and I haven’t tried every Single peel out there (it feels like that tho), but this is the best I’ve found by a big margin. Since I was otherwise going to pay for professional peels, the $90 that seemed kinda steep now seems like a bargain & I’m grateful to have found it. Try it if you need serious exfoliating!\n",
      "…read more I have owned and used this peel/mask for a little under 6 months now. I’ve used it regularly once a week or every other week. I like exfoliating and don’t have really sensitive skin so I have a few that I cycle through, hoping to find my ONE. I’m discovering is there isn’t a “1” exfoliator. I want a couple. I want baby facial or goops instant facial on my counter because they’re effective as heck, I like the way they feel, and they’re strong and really good for days when I really need a good hard exfoliation. But sometimes? Sometimes I am on my period, my skin is acting up and puffy and I just don’t want that ‘rip my skin off’ feeling. Sometimes it’s Sunday and I want to mask excessively. Sometimes I want to wear a mask for an hour and not have my family ask me what the heck is on your face. And on those days, this is the one for me. Let me tell you why I love this. 1. I LOVE the smell. It’s lime-y but not overwhelming. 2. It’s creamy and not gritty. When I know my skin is off, I really don’t want to scrub away my barrier with any grit. This has none. It’s like a velvety cream. Because of this as I said I can wear it without being stared at. 3. It’s effective. It’s not as strong as baby facial and it has zero grit to it, but it definitely leaves a glow and I do feel like it’s done it’s job when it’s done. It feels a lot like Tatas resurfacing mask. Gentle, but effective. 4. I love the packaging. It’s pretty and I like having it on my counter. As I said I’ve had it for about 6 months now, it’s less than half gone. It comes with a neat little spoon. It has been something of a task to keep track of that but I have and I’m glad because I haven’t put my fingers in the tub once. Yes this is pricey. But it’s worth it. At this rate I’ll only need to replace about once a year and when it runs out I will replace it. It annoys me how many reviews there are on this product who received a free one two years ago and now there’s barely any reviews on it. Its a good find\n",

Love this peel! The blend of glycolic/phytic/and retinol reduces the appearance of discoloration, which I'm starting to notice. It's effective but gentle, I never notice redness even if I leave it on for 15 minutes. Best beauty product I purchased this year. Noticable difference in my skin tone/texture by the 2nd use.

This product makes my face feel silky smooth and my skin looks so nice after! I don’t use this often as it was so expensive but i use it as a treat and it’s so worth the money! I leave this on for an hour and then rinse off you don’t need much just a thin layer on the face and you will see results :)! This product is AMAZING! I have fair, oily, extremely sensitive skin, and I have been diagnosed with rosacea; I have tried hundreds of products to help remove the redness and treat rosacea breakouts, but nothing has worked except medication prescribed by my dermatologist. However, I cannot take this medication while trying to conceive or while pregnant, and my skin has been such a mess. This Lancer caviar lime acid peel is the ONLY over-the-counter product that has calmed down my rosacea flairs, and it has helped me feel so much more confident. This peel smells divine and really works! It is worth every penny! I have found that a tiny amount (think 1/8 of a teaspoon) covers my entire face, so this product will last a long time. I can't recommend it highly enough. Go try it in a Sephora store!\n",

One of the best Vitamin C Serum I've ever used! Love it and worth every dollar! Love all of my DDG products. I have noticed a reduction in dark spots and an overall brighter complexion within my first week of use. Would recommend and will continue to use through my first full bottle to see the final results. These people who complain about the bottle being half full, they crack me up. You are paying for 1 ounce of product, and there is one ounce of product in the bottle. The bottle needs to be larger to accommodate the pump mechanism! No one is trying to cheat you. Anyway, I have only been using this (in combo with the other items from the Skin Heroes kit) for about 4 days now but already feel a firmness and plumpness to my \"just beginning to get crepey\" skin. This definitely turned back the clock a little. I am going to continue with Dr. Dennis Gross products except remain with my Kiehl's sunscreen, because the DDG sunscreen is too drying for me.

This body wash has been a staple in my shower for 3 years. I repurchase it over and over because it’s the only product I’ve found that consistently keeps me from breaking out on my back. I miss it and notice a difference on days that I skip it. Highly recommend for anyone trying to control breakouts on the body. This has been the only thing that works for my back and chest acne. I have used Proactiv in the past which is somewhat drying but doesn’t really deliver results for myself. I also use the toner spray on my chest and back after cleansing my skin.

I did some careful research and all signs pointed towards this product. I’ve been using this product daily with a silicone exfoliating mitt post workout and my skin is absolutely transformed. I’m basically a Murad disciple at this point and can’t wait to get my hands on more of their products! Absolutely love. Doesn’t dry out skin. I do recommend this being the last thing you use/do in the shower. Idk if it’s just me but I use to wash my hair last...not anymore. But I love this stuff. Worked amazing for my back acne. I LOVE that this product had biodegradable scrubby bits. I was horrified to learn how damaging most scrubs are to the environment. I love exfoliating by body as well as my face, but I don't want to use all my ExfoliKate just for my back and chest since it's so expensive. This was a savior. It works pretty well, I've been using it on my shoulders, back, and my bum. It is definitely helps dry out your skin. The blackheads just come to the surface and are so easy to remove! I highly recommend using it with the body spray. Its not a miracle worker, but it get the job done for sure! Its a little pricey, but its so worth it! This product has saved my skin. I used to hide my arms, but don't have to now. Worked better than any wash from a dermatologist, is not drying and I believe the licorice root extract in it heals scarring. I can't say enough about this product from Murad! I have had problems with my body acne since going off the pill and getting and IUD. While this doesn't completely clear it up, it makes it so much better! I paired it with the spray and it helps even more. One of the fastest acting products I have ever used. After using it as a mask and washing it off my face as instructed, my skin was noticeably smoother and softer immediately — more so than after any other mask/peel I have tried. However, the real magic happened when I used it as an overnight spot treatment on darkened acne scars. After one night of use they had lightened immensely with zero irritation.

I actually regrets wasting it for weeks without trying a combo. I definitely will repurchase. Gentle and effective! This was my first foray into chemical exfoliators, and I’m hooked. I’m 35, and turns out that chemical exfoliators are necessary because our skin doesn’t renew like it used to. This helps it feel smooth and clean, I used it a few times a week and love it. Amazing mask. My skin is glowbig and bright after. It says to apply a thick layer (like the girl in the picture). I don’t put it on that thick but I see noticeable results. I just used up some other face masks and I’m going to be putting this one into the rotation twice a week. Can’t wait to see even more results. i have sensitive dry skin and this didn’t irritate it or make any dry patches more noticeable. i had acne and occasionally will get a big breakout but this noticeably helps with the leftover texture from that. you can see a difference in one use, and even more so within a couple. i would definitely buy it again. This product has helped my face fade away spots, it even minimized my pores and some blemishes disappeared! My face looks plumped, brighter and smooth. My skin is so sensitive and this product is very very gentle on my face. The product is creamy and will last for months! I will DEFINITELY keep buying it! Is a very good product. I use this in my night routine and sometimes in the morning to give a little extra boost to my skin. It absorbs instantly and has a very delicate floral smell ( lovely)! Great product. I’ve been using it for a few years. I’m obsessed with this serum, so much so that I gave it to my sister for Christmas. She loves it too. Also, it smells so amazing. I love this product, when my skin is feeling and looking dull i just using this either by itself or with my moisturizer and bam glowing skin... I loved this serum. My face is usually very oily, and after adding this hydrating serum to my routine; Everything changed. My skin still is somewhat oily, but it has minimized after using this serum. Not only does it hydrate but you can feel as it starts to work it's magic, lol. Also, the smell is amazing. If I could give it 10 stars I would. I have really oily skinny and this is amazing and not to oil . But really works at the same time I bought this for my husband to add to his skin routine. He likes it. It keeps his skin hydrated and smooth. Then he applies a men’s oil free moisturizer with SPF. The pump bottle makes it nice to distribute on the hands. I’ve been struggling with acne the past few years, especially hormonal acne. I’ve tried just about everything to clear it up. I have dry skin and most acne products i tried just dried my skin out excessively. This is the first product that is actually working and doesn’t strip my skin of moisture. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin is clearing up including the hormonal stuff. It’s also helped with texture and lightened up my acne scars. You should definitely try a sample first to make sure it’s okay for your skin, but I will recommend this product for anyone.\n",
      "…read more This is a really good product. It is worth the price because it has BOTH glycolic acid and salicylic acid, that too in very significant percentages. I used it for 3months so far. I was really consistent for about 3 weeks, took a 1month break because i got busy, then started again for more than 6weeks now. It has helped get rid of texture on my face, small bumps, and prevents small acne from developing around chin, temples, and forehead. Make sure to use it at least 1 hour before bed because it is most effective when it situs on your skin versus getting rubbed off when you sleep. Pro-tip: if you have 3 hours in the morning before work/school, I'd also apply it first thing in the morning and then rinse off. Give it at least 2 hours, preferably 3 before rinsing.\n",

This cleared EVERYTHING up! It's uncanny how quickly and effectively I saw results after only 2 days!! this is a MUST purchase I have fair skin with a lot of acne no matter the time of the month situation. Then even if I don’t pick at a zit I get a red mark that lasts for months! (I use a Korean skin care step system. I just added this to the mix and am very happy! It helps drop the swelling in zits coming in and does wonders to help with my post acne marks as well. The size of this bottle is fantastic too. A little goes a long way. This will last me for months. I would recommend it for anyone with acne and light (not deep pocket-cuz I don’t know if it will work on that) scars!\n",
      "…read more I use this with skin laundry brightening serum every night, it does wonders! The bottle lasts me 4 months cause you only need two pumps. Works better then Clinique acne, proactive and any clean and clear products. I am on my second bottle of the PTR Acne Clearing Gel and honestly love the results. It’s pretty gentle on the skin, and gives nice hydration as well as keeping breakouts to a minimum. Highly recommend this product if you’re struggling with acne and have dry skin; it truly helps! I use it on the back of my neck where my hair makes my neck break out sometimes this really helps I use this mostly for acne spot treatment on my chin and chest No regrets here! Keeps my skin clear without over drying. Absorbs quickly. A little goes a long way. I originally tried this in the Acne System and this was by far my favorite!! I don’t break out often but whenever I see the slightest sign of a bump, I put this on before going to bed and come morning it’s GONE!!! I also think this works to reduce the appearance of blackheads in my nose area. There’s also no weird smell like a lot of acne clearing products have. I struggled with acne since I was 12. I tried everything from face washes to creams to proactive. Nothing seemed to really work for me. If anything did somewhat work it would heavily dry my skin out. I was towards the end of becoming totally defeated when I decided to try dietary pills. I came across these and after reading reviews I decided why not. I have to say THESE ARE AMAZING. Yes $50 a month for a bottle is a lot but I have never had anything work this well for me. I used to get super bad under the skin pimples and after taking these I never have them or hardly any acne anymore. These have also made my skin appear smoother, brighter, and hydrated. I have only been taking these for a month and have already seen such a significant difference to my skin. If you’re at the end of trying things just try this. It’s the best thing I’ve ever used for my skin.\n",

I'm in my mid 30s and have suffered from moderate, often cystic acne for over a decade. I didn't see results in the first bottle, but around week 6 my skin completely cleared up.

Always deep, cystic acne and in the warmer months some acne on my top forehead. I’ve given this product time to work and even made the mistake of using it for over a month and not getting a new bottle fast enough when it started to work. Give it time. It’s has made an obvious difference in my skin for months now. I absolutely believe that my acne is hormonal and this has really given me more confidence in my skin. It’s not perfect but nothing compared to where it was!\n",
      "…read more This is my second bottle purchasing. Normally i have between moderate to severe acne, it just depends really. This keeps mine around mild and with the right skincare its controlled. Im so blessed to have found this. After years of eyeing this and seeing my cousin using it with glowing skin, I took the plunge. I have suffered from acne my entire life and have taken so many prescriptions that had undesirable side effects. Read reviews for this and thought to give it a chance. I’ve now been taking it over a year and it has completely cleared up my skin! Don’t debate getting it if you have any acne issues. I can now feel confident in showing my skin. LOVE THESE SUPPLEMENTS!!! IVE BATTLED WITH ACNE FOR OVER 12 YEARS AND THESE HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL IN CLEARING UP MY SKIN, NOT A COMPLETE FIX BUT A SERIOUS IMPROVEMENT ^_^ I tooted in the cocoa puffs I’ve used a lot of supplements looking for the perfect one for my skin and honestly this one works the best Life changing. I’ve been through it all, including accutane. I still have breakouts and texture concerns and these keep my skin in really good shape. I’ve even tried to stop taking them or try a cheaper one and my breakouts come right back. I hope they never discontinue these!!! I waited 2 months to write this review. Ya'll. Let me tell youuu. I was hoping this wouldn't work because they stink but i refuse to live without these. I had weird hormonal acne that only formed on my cheeks. Sometimes cystic, but usually just a cluster of small pimples and it was so ugly lol. I'm 21 and have never had bad skin but it started forming at 19. I cut out dairy and basically everything else people said were bad for skin and it did nothing. Do you know how hard it is to not eat ice cream or pizza? I came across these and was like why not! I noticed a difference in 2 weeks and it completely cleared my acne in a month tops. Not only that, but its keeping it clear! I get an occasional pimple here and there but its gone in a day or two. I will continue to use this until I feel like I don't need to anymore. Sidenote: I also take zinc and fish oil with these daily.(Zinc is amazing for acne. These pills have a very low dose so I take an extra supplement). I hear selenium is also great but haven't tried. I also only take two of these a day now since i'm just trying to maintain my skin.\n",
      "…read more Best product I’ve ever used! This supplements changed my skin perfectly Previously, only prescription antibiotics would stop the breakouts and as I didn't want to take those forever, I was looking for another oral solution. These pills have worked REALLY well for me. After 2 months, I switch to only taking once a day. I would definitely give this a try! This product is unexplainable. I have struggled with acne for as long as I can remember. This is the first review I have ever done on any product because this ACTUALLY WORKS. I was even on proactive at one point but my acne was still coming through. I have tried everything you could name but it seemed as if I was at a loss. I was even prescribed certain birth control pills to help with my acne but even then I was still having a constant battle with my acne. Nothing was lessening my breakouts but when I tell you I have no acne on my face at all... I promise. No exaggeration. I was always so insecure with my skin, but this product gave me all the self confidence I need. Please if you are hesitant about this please I beg of you to give this a try. I will never not use this supplement. I am so thankful I gave this a chance. I could not be any more thankful, God Bless you Murad!!!\n",
      "…read more So I have a tendency to use all kinds of different things and not let my skin get used to anything. I have a beauty box subscription and I just like trying new stuff. I got sick of my face getting red at the drop of a hat (I have a touch of rosacea and then things like temperature, alcohol consumption, and stress would make me go beet red) so the lovely associate at Sephora recommended I use either this or Dr. Jart daily. I liked the texture and smell of this serum better than Dr. Jart so I committed to using it every day, twice a day. One pump is sufficient for covering my whole face perfectly, and the smell is lovely. (While it's a 'natural' fragrance, it's still an added fragrance, so my bff can't use it, which makes me sad.) I now use it twice a day religiously and it took 4-6 weeks but now I really don't get red at all any more, in any circumstance. I have the sniffles right now and my nose isn't even red from blowing it so much. I need less redness coverage with makeup and I don't notice a ton of temperature changes either. The bottle will probably last me about two months, but it's worth it to me to continue buying it. If you use it religiously, it will work!\n",

I have had light rosacea for years and I feel like this product really helped to reduce my redness. My skin is incredibly sensitive and this serum did not burn or irritate my skin upon application. It didn’t create any little bumps either - I would highly recommend this product! I notice a visible difference in my acne and cystic acne when I run out of this product. It reduces my redness, keeps my skin calm, and feels great. I apply it under my prescription creams and give it a few minutes to soak in. I flinch every time at the high pricetag, but it always pays for itself! This stuff saved my skin, i have supper pale skin thats dry sensitive so i often would experience redness after washing. plus found it impossible to exfoliate without breaking out. Not only did this reduce the redness in my face i can actually use chemical exfoliators without breaking out. (Its the same brand of exfoliator i was using before and after) I still see the benefits from the exfoliators this stuff just strengthen my skin barrier. Overall the irritation and redness has decreased 10 folds. Holy grail stuff for those with supper sensitive skin. I use it every day!! Should note it doesn't clog pores at all. Really Recommend\n",
      "…read more I Looooooove this product! I have really sensitive skin. Whenever I got allergy, I put it on the areas that were itchy and red. It stopped the itchiness right away! Great product! Will definitely repurchase it! Love love love this serum. Keeps my sensitive, oily, acne prone skin happy year round. I use it in conjunction with the moisturizer, and both are wonderful. Definitely recommend to anyone with similar skin issues I love this serum! It does not irritate and reduces redness. It also helps prep my skin before makeup as I feel it does add some moisture to my skin. Have seen beautiful results in 4 days. Skin is noticeably brighter, totally worth the money and will continue to buy. Only con is packaging, I have long acrylic nails so it makes it reaaaally hard to push out the serum every morning & night. I love this product! I have tried several vitamin C products, and this one has made the most noticeable difference to my skin in reducing dark spots, scarring and evening tone. It also smells nice. I am 51 and very dry with sun damage. I have used so many vit c serums and am shocked that after only 1 week of using this, I see a huge difference in the brightness and discoloration on my checks and forehead. I have been using this product every day in the morning only and will continue to do. I struggled finding a pure Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) serum that didn't oxidize or irritate my skin. Drunk Elephants C Firma, while a quality product, was too strong for my skin and oxidized too quickly for me. I've been using Clinique's formula for only a few days now, it I will definitely be repurchasing. My skin is visibly brightened and evened out . I'm AA with med-deep skin tone and I've always had clear skin, but struggle with an even skin tone, darker jaw area (common for women of color) for as along as I can remember. The first day I put this on, I didn't think it was working because it didn't \"sting,\" (myth, I know) but it I gave it a few days and definitely saw the difference. Vitamin C is generally a product you have to be patience with and won't always see overnight results. Great formula and genius packaging.\n",
      "…read more Love! My skin is glowing immediately after use and it makes such a difference under makeup. I became a fresh pressed Vitamin C junkie a little over a year ago. The first one I ever tried was by No7 and it worked quite well at first. After some time though, I wasn’t noticing the same glowing results and decided to look for other options. I’m a Sunday Riley, and Tatcha skincare fanatic, but really wanted to stick to the fresh pressed Vitamin C serums which neither of those companies offer. Connie who works at my local Sephora recommended Clinique’s version to me. I already use their Moisture Surge Eye Concentrate and Clinique ID hydrating jelly and love both so naturally I was excited to give this a try as well. I’ve been officially using their Fresh Pressed Vitamin C Serum now for approximately 8 months and I am still just as happy with the results as I was on day one. The last Fresh Vitamin C I used seemed to stop giving the same results after about five months of use. This product still brightens and boosts my skins appearance. I’ve noticed a huge difference in fine lines and unevenness. My skin glows after every use. If I run out for a few days before I’m able to get to the store to buy more I can tell a major difference in my skins appearance. I’m 42 and honestly get mistaken for being in my early to mid 30’s all the time. I’ve always taken very good care of my skin thanks to my mother insisting I did so starting in my pre-teen years. I know my skin care regimen all these years has been a major contributor in how I look now in my 40’s, but without this Vitamin C serum my skin looks dull. You can use this serum alone although I recommend using it in tandem with your favorite night or day moisturizer at first, If you’ve never tried Fresh Pressed Vitamin C before, because it can cause irritation to some people’s skin as can any new product. Never introduce more than 1 new product into your skin care regimen at a time so you know which product to eliminate if any adverse side effects occur. I Hope you give this product a try and love it as much as I have!\n",
      "…read more I’ve used this product for only 3 days & I already see a huge difference. I’ve tried a lot of home remedies and masks in the past but none seemed to work. I tried a few products from the ordinary and they helped a little bit not much. After my friend told me to use vitamin C I saw this and decided to give it a shot. Really suggest using this product I never write reviews, but just had to over this serum! It is the most amazing Vitamin C product I have ever used, hands down. I have been using it nightly and day for a week and dark spots around my eyes and cheeks have virtually disappeared. (And I have slight rosacea around my nose and cheeks and it did not irritate it!) It literally looks like my skin has been lit within! Try this product. You won’t be sorry! Loved this! The 2nd or 3rd day I used this I noticed immediate results my skin looked brighter and my skin was much tighter i do wish there was more product in the bottle and the smell isn’t bad it’s just not amazing but so far this is my favorite serum and I will buy this agin! This is great! I am not a person that notices changes with products; so can't tell you the ''effects''. But I love the vitamin C formula. I mix it with the Vichy Mineral 89 in the morning; it absorbs quickly and I apply a moisturizing sunscreen after and it's perfect! My skin didn't react to it; so it's great! I must admit I was a skeptic. I have tried a myriad of treatments including professional facials for my congested pores and nothing has worked.... until this! After just one use the blackheads on my chin and nose were essentially gone and my skin’s texture is smooth. Would recommend 100 times over, it really works! This product is amazing! It’s really cool because the cream and the scrubber work together to really extract blackheads, whiteheads, and other oil from your face. It just brought everything that was in my pores to the surface and then scrubbed it all away! I might be addicted to using this! Super effective! I have had very stubborn blackheads on my nose and chin for years. This completely eradicates the blackheads on my chin and greatly reduces the amount on my nose. Plus, it leaves my skin feeling super soft. It's not a miracle product but if you suffer from persistent blackheads, it's definitely a good find for your arsenal. Love this stuff! We took a before and after picture of my teen, and in two weeks it made a huge difference. Will definitely repurchase! So good. You can feel the difference and see the difference quickly. I’ve tried a lot of blackhead removing options and this is my favourite for sure. Pros: Moisturizing, long-lasting, effective wrinkle keeper-at-bay. Cons: A bit slow to dry. Brand context: I use Algenist's liquid collagen occasionally. Love love love this product. My ultimate favourite in algenist. What a difference to my eyelid. No more crepeness. Crows feet less and better youthful looking skin under eye. I am almost 58 and have wrinkles. My eyes are most definitely improved. Love this product! Won’t be without. Been using it for over a year and it's my holy grail. Had puffy eyes I could not get rid of and this work like magic. I use this with their renewal balm and my fine lines are gone. To be honest I wasn’t sure at first if it was the eye cream, but after a few months of use I know this works. I am in airplanes all the time and between the dryness and lack of any kind of sleep routine it can take its toll, but this wiped away all those little lines and restored some moisture. Love love love. I was so heartbroken when the gel was discontinued because it was the best I found. I tried a couple of products in between trying this because of its price but they did not work out. I bit the bullet and bought this product and glad I did! I don't say this often, but Algenist's Power Advanced Eye serum has MADE. A. DIFFERENCE. in my eye discoloration! It's also helped with lines, but for me, the most significant improvement has been in the reduction of dark circles -- and I'm certainly not getting any more sleep! Love this eye serum! I have dry skin, am in my late 40s, and have serious under eye circles. This serum is fantastic! Does it eliminate my under eye circles? No, but nothing at any price range (and I use La Mer for my face cream — I’m willing to shell out for something that works) ever has. This serum does lighten them, though, and I definitely think it’s helping to diminish the look of fine lines. I do pat a bit of my face moisturizer over top, as I need a lot of hydration, but when I forget to do that, I find this serum is pretty darn moisturizing on its own. I have sensitive skin, but I’ve had zero issues with this product. Highly recommend it!\n",

Decided at 29 that I needed to get into more preventative face care asked for several different serums for Christmas and then tried each for two weeks and this one was by far the best and still is. I actually realized how much I liked it because I noticed that I liked the way my face looked in photos more with this serum.

I may have just imagined it based on all the great reviews but I swear this stuff works with the 1st use. I did cleanse and tone first but I dont think toning is required. Whenever I put this on I feel a bit shiny and brand new and then my face absorbs it and starts working it’s magic! It feels so good and comfortable on my face. I love it , the best .. for this weather . This stuff is amazing. I have some age spots on my chest that I’ve used every product imaginable on including chemical peels and nothing even touched them. I got a sample of this in my Ipsy bag and have been putting it on the age spots for about a month. Every single age spot has either vanished or is in the process of vanishing. I just ordered a new bottle. Feels good as I put it on but it leaves my skin shiny. I wish I didn't love this so much because it is pricey but it's so worth it. I have dry sensitive skin and this keepse dewy and fresh I also noticed a significant difference on my fine lines. This serum is worth it!! I had been using this product very happily and changed to Le Crue by Caudalie when it came out. I found that product very drying on my skin and have since returned to this. It is moisturizing and works better on my dry skin. This product delivers results in a week! It was non irritating and I loved the texture. My skin felt tighter and brighter. Definitely worth the price!! I bought this product a month ago and I can already see the difference. My skin stays hydrated longer during the day and I can see the fine lines softening. Loving it! It’s the best! I have tried others, cheaper and more expensive and this is the winner! Feel it working and it lifts my face and tightens. It was my first product and thought others would do the same. Wrong! I am back to stay! Ps. No issues with sensitivity I am starting to develop a real obsession with Caudalie. As someone who has tried countless firming products over the last couple years, I can tell you this works! And pretty much immediately. I use it morning and night and can visibly see my skin looking tighter but also more supple. I wake up every morning and touch my face and it just feels “fuller”. Lol.

I'm 52 and going through a stressful period nowadays , plus multiple health issues but despite these factors, my skin looks amazing since I've started using this serum.

I still have some redness and the odd breakout but the deep acne has gone away. This serum is so light and doesn’t make your skin oily at all. I really like this product, I’m in my mid 30s and I still breakout. I’ve been using the face wash day and night and I use this product at night, it dried my face out using it twice a day. It’s doing its job by keeping my face from total breakout, I still get 1 or 2 zits here and there. I use this more as a preventative treatment than a spot treatment. Worn under moisturizer at night, it smooths out my skin, sliiiightly diminishes the darkness of scars, but definitely helped prevent acne flair ups. Any hormonal acne is less severe and disappears much more quickly. One of the best non-prescription products I've tried. I started using this in my skin care routine 2 months ago, and I LOVE it. Salicylic Acid is so important to my routine now. It has helped reduce the amount of black heads and reduce my pore size significantly. I highly recommend adding this to your routine.

My face is less oily, the texture is mostly gone, and I have an even skin tone (I've been really insecure by this). This formula is perfect. When I break out I only get one or two pimples, but they are gone within days. My breakouts used to be bad! Not anymore and I'm so thankful.

I've followed the instructions for this kit but also supplemented with extra moisture since it's cold and dry out by using the Lapis Herbivore facial oil under the Kate moisturizer during the day and the Olehenrikson vitamin c moisturizer at night. After just a few days following this routine, my skin looks clear and feels so bouncy and soft - I can't believe it. The only issue I have is with the eradiKate spot treatment. It smells really strongly of isopropyl alcohol and is a little painful when applied to spots. I can only use it at night but it does seem to work well so I will keep using it.\n",
      "…read more Love all the products! Yes it’s a trial sized box obviously, but they are great for travel. You get a lot of product for what you're paying for. The cleanser its really good, I only use it at night but feels good on the skin. The pink spot treatment is AWESOME, I always had horrible pimples on my chin, I tried a lot of creams before but nothing worked like this. The pimples despair completely after 2 or 3 days COMPLETELY!!! The moisturizer is ok too, nothing really amazing but does the job. I truly love Kate Somerville kits! it works if you use it consistently. Please do not try to use the acne treatments without the moisturizer because it will dry your skin and increase your breakouts. At least thats what happened to me when I ran out of the moisturizer for few a while. I found the moisturizers and the acne treatment in glass bottle to be the best. You don't see results fast but definitely see a huge improvement overtime. Btw their moisturizer is great!\n",
      "…read more This product cleanses and moisturizes my sensitive and reactive skin so well. I bought as a gift-set to try it out and I fell in love with it and I plan to buy the full-size products once this runs out. My skin is looking amazing!!!!!!! And bonus perfect for travel!! Bought this my daughter who has issues with breakouts in her forehead and chin. She loves it and keeps her face clear and well moisturized. I have been using this set for about 2 weeks now. I would say that it has really helped to clear some some hormonal/stress related acne I was suffering from. I would wash my face to remove makeup and then use the acne face wash followed by the two treatment products. The oil free moisturizer is very light. It is very good for around the house or under makeup that has SPF as it doesn't have any. I have been trying to find products to clear my hormonal breakouts for a while and this cleared a lot of it up in a short amount of time, 1-2 weeks. I’ve tried many products but this kit made such a huge difference in my skin. Although it’s pricey, it was definitely worth it for me. I have combo skin and my main breakouts are around my hairline and forehead. This really worked for me. Okay guys so this is day 4 using this kit and IT CHANGED MY LIFE! Listen, the real stars are the salicylic acid treatment with retinol and the acne treatment. I know for the acne treatment is supposed to be used as a spot treatment my boyfriend wen ahead and applied it to my whole face.. lol I have a lot of little bumps under my chin and neck making me look like a crunch bar and the next morning, BOOM, GONE! Im so serious too. The cleanser feels so rich and frothy (: The moisturizer is really good too nothing fancy or game changing it's just nice to pair with the salicylic acid treatment at night. If you'e been wanting to try this line this kit is supper dope. But if you get something out of this definitely get the sulfur treatment and salicylic acid!!!\n",
      "…read more So far so good! I was very sceptical at first when they told me to try this. So far i’m very impressed. With only one pump for my entire face, my skin looks nourish, hydrated and younger! I can definitly say that I’m going to buy again. It is for sure part of my skin care routine forever! I wish I'd found this sooner! I watch Dr. Sandra Lee's videos (aka Dr. Pimple Popper) and I noticed that she recommends retinoid products to her patients with milia. I decided to give this one a try, and wow I'm so glad I did! Within 1 WEEK the milia under my eyes had improved, and after using it for a few months there's been a huge difference. The milia under my eyes are still there, but they've shrunken so much they're barely noticeable. I've also noticed that I get fewer little whiteheads - I used to get them all over my face, now I only have to deal with maybe 2 or 3 at a time. Compared to other retinoid products out there, this one is relatively inexpensive. I'm still using the first bottle I bought (I got another one during the VIB sale), and I've had it for... almost 4 months? The only downside is that the smell is a little off-putting. I really wish I'd taken \"before\" pictures for comparison!\n",
      "…read more Overall very pleased with product. Ingredients and quality are on point. Drys quickly. No strong smell. Good packaging to help protect air and light sensitive ingredients plus you get a decent amount of product for the price! Just started using this so cannot say if it helps with fine lines but definitely leaves the skin very smooth, plumped and well hydrated afterwards. No greasy or sticky feeling whatsoever. Light, quick absorption and even though I personally haven't been using daily, there's a notable improvement on my skin's texture and tone. Interesting enough, I've been getting compliments on my skin every single day! If I had started using this in my twenties I'd probably still look like I was in my twenties. No other product improves my skin as quickly or effectively. I bought this product on a whim and I have not been disappointed. I use it daily underneath my makeup and at night before bed, dries very quickly. It moisturizers and plumps my skin perfectly without feeling heavy .The only draw back of this product is the smell, it’s a little off putting but goes away very quickly. My husband has a combination of oily and dry skin, with a bit of redness on his cheeks. He uses this everyday and puts it on right out of the shower. It really helped his complexion. The price is a bit steep for the size of the bottle, but a little goes a long way. I absolutely love the scent as well! Subtle but nice. I have struggled with hormonal cystic acne my whole life. This product is INCREDIBLE. I use it as an overnight mask. In the morning, my skin feels so smooth and my acne is 100 times better. I wouldn’t recommend it for sensitive skin, but otherwise, it’s perfect. Don’t give up!! As someone who is suffering from cystic hormonal painful mid 20s acne this mask has changed my life. I have tried it all, and after trying this and seeing results, I’m hopeful once again that there is still products out here that work and help! My husband is obsessed with it. No need to say more. Oh, it works for spot traitement for breakout. I don’t have acne so I can’t help there. I’m pregnant and suffering from terrible hormonal acne. This helps me keep it under control. The smell is strong but I definitely don’t pick things for my skin based on the smell. This is super effective. I have incredibly acne prone and oily skin. I use this about once a week using the directions on the back and truly feel that this helps keep my acne at bay. Smells like sulfur, but it *is* made of sulfur, and it doesn't seem to have added fragrance, which is nice. I am pretty sure that Sunday Riley is also cruelty free and vegan, which is a great perk when looking for great skincare! As others have said, holy grail. I have extraordinarily stubborn skin that I’ve finally gotten mostly under control at the end of my twenties with a combination of meds (spironolactone, birth control) and a tried and true cocktail of micellar water, face lotion for burn victims, and retinoids. But despite all of this, I still get some hormonal acne monthly, and it holds on for dear life. Not with this. I’ve had some luck with sulfur in the past where other products have failed, but this is in a league of its own. It makes a difference as a spot treatment overnight.\n",
      "…read more Perfect for pesky breakout as an over night treatment. Strong sulfur odor but dissipates quickly. I have combination skin so it tends to dry out my cheeks and right now since I am treating my adult acne with other products it not a favorable combination. Regardless it is a keeper to have handy. A must-have magic treatment when you have to stay up late. This product does exactly what it says it does. I have used it numerous times and thank my lucky stars that I found it. Two hours of sleep, no problem. This product definitely helps with recovery. Makes you skin feel like silk and it smells great too. I understand where other reviewers expected a larger tube, however, this is not suppose to be an everyday product (though you could if you wanted I'm sure). This is one of those emergency products that everyone should have in their back pocket. I always have some on hand!\n",
      "…read more I love this product a lot, especially the smell, but I wish they have bigger size of the cream . I have a newborn and sleep is hard to come by these days which does nothing good for my skin! Using this mask has really helped my skin become less stressed and look less tired!! For the price point it was totally worth it!! You will thank yourself later! I have used up one tube and it works really well. I'm a full-time engineering student and staying up all night is probably like my weekly routine. Whenever I feel dull and dehydrated on my skin, I just apply a layer of this onto my face and I could rise with a healthy glow on my face. Even though this does no good to my dark circles, still it balances oil and water when my skin is dehydrated during awaken nights.\n",
      "…read more Loved this cream. Yeah its small but you don't need a lot. Works well and smells so good! I use this a little differently. I use it every night before going to bed, after cleaning my face. Weirdly, it solves my acne problem and my facial skin just loves it. First of all, yes it is small for the price. Is it worth it? Absolutely!! It’s not meant to be used everyday. When I do, I notice a significant difference in my skin. Friends and family have too. If you’re in the fence about it, I’d say give it a try. You’ll be glad you did For those of you who complain that the size of it is tiny - it is NOT meant to be used every night. It's an express help for the days when you went to bed very late. Look at Guerlain's price tag for the skincare - this product is a STEAL. Works just amazing. I use this anytime I know I may not be getting much sleep or if I want to look particularly nice the next day. I don't know what type of voodoo magic this cream holds, but I always feel that I look fresh when I wake up! It is a bit pricey but defintiely worth it! I have no idea why they make this in deluxe sample size, I'd buy in bulk if I could. It is that amazing. Magical product! Must try if u have to stay up late sometimes. This product is AMAZING!! I’ve had scars since I was a teen and have been breaking out a lot lately from stress. (I will admit, I’m a popper...it’s awful). But after just two nights my skin was noticeably clearer. Plus, all the acne I had when I started disappeared! It’s been less than a week and I’m already feeling so much more confident! I know it’ll take time for everything to fade, but I have faith now! I had a crazy amount of acne at one point due to hormone imbalance & I couldn’t help but pick at my face & I had soooo many scars left over and was really scared they’d stay forever. Luckily for me I picked up this product and use it every night & I can genuinely say I love it and will continue to use it for a while. My acne scars are basically all gone. Had a lot of acne prone skin and was looking for something to help reduce my dark spots and even my skin tone. Saw a difference in my skin in about 2 weeks. Just ordered a new one hopefully I keep seeing more improvement. PLUS little to NO IRRITATION!! which is always what I'm looking for. This has always been my favorite! It helps the most with my acne and blemishes. It does sting a little, but I don’t mind it. Love it! Amazing. I have brown hyperpigmented skin and this gel lightened a scar on my chin in just a few weeks. A friend asked if I had concealer on over it. Brown girls--try this! I have suffered from acne throughout the years and I am prone to acne scars because I have a tendency to pick at my skin. Once I became pregnant the acne worsened and nothing seemed to work. I read all the reviews and was hesitant because of the price but I tried it and within two weeks a majority of my scars disappeared. I added photos of before and after only two weeks of use This stuff is great for everyone. The time:results ratio is different for everyone. Mine took like 2 weeks, but it does lighten the scarring considerably. Looking forward to getting my next bottle. A few months ago I sampled this product and in desperation decided to buy the full size and give it a try. I know it’s a bit spendy especially when you’re a college student but best decision ever. I have had acne scars for as long as I can remember and hadn’t found anything that really made a difference until I came across this product. It really does give long lasting results and now I swear by it. Definitely going to be stocking up on Murad products from now on.\n",
      "…read more I never had acne until I turned 22 and it was really bad my face was left with stains and I would use so much makeup to cover them up, after using this product for 2 weeks my face looks so much better. Im in love with this product. Omg I love this product. I bough this about three weeks ago and at first I was a little skeptic and the price was a little too much but I decided to give it a try anyway. I have used several different pricey products for my pimples and pimple scars and nothing really worked until I tried this. I wear it every night after I wash my face throughly and in two weeks my face is 95% clear of all my scars and I have not gotten a single new pimple since I started using it. This thing really works and i am in love with my face now. I don’t even wear foundation sometimes because my face looks and feels so amazing and soft. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "…read more I've tried so many different brightening/scar fading products and this is definitely one of my favorites. I had lots of pigmentation along my chin/jawline and within a few weeks I noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference. I use it AM and PM and only apply the gel to areas that need lightening. Amazing product - seriously worth it!!!! Wow this product surely does work! I think the key is just to be consistent when applying this over whichever spot/scar you’re trying to fade/get rid of. I’ve been using it for only a week maybe and I’m definitely noticing a difference. You have to be patient with hyperpigmentation so I understand I won’t see full results for a little while but I know it’s going to come from using this product! Feels great on the skin.. will continue to use it under the ultra facial cream. No scent and very light weight LOVE this product. I never had problems with my skin until after pregnancy. I tried everything to get my skin under control. Nothing worked. Products would either dry out my skin or make me break out more. This product keeps my skin hydrated without being too heavy. It also has left my skin feeling really soft. This is my do or die moisturizer. So simple and packs a huge punch. I use it nightly with my tretinoin cream and it helps keep my face from drying out and I wake up to the most plump face ever! I have recommended this to everyone who would listen and never got negative feedback. This changed my skin within a week. I Live in a cold climate area, and this is a must have for me. I have dry skin within a week I seen changes to my skin. It was smooth. Soft and I’m getting so many compliments on how much better my skin look. The high price is most definitely worth it. I have been using this serum for years now and LOVE it. I tried less expensive products and haven't seen the same smoothness and moisture I get from this one. Totally worth it My fave serum - and I’ve tried a million. Cheaper than the Plantscriptions I used to use. Definitely notice a more youthful appearance. Got used to the silicone-like texture. It’s gives my skin a perfect balance of moist. I’ve always been a Kiehl’s fan, but this is by far my favourite facial product. The perfect level of hydration. Moisturizing but not oily or drying. It reminds me of the Chanel hyrda serum or the Kate Summerville wrinkle warrior serum/moisturizer. My skin is oily and combination during the winter. I find it difficult to find a great moisturizer that isn’t to thick and isn’t too matte. Really nice product! I love this. good for dry skin. I use with the Kiehls New Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil during day before moisturizer and makeup. I have tried m as my at home facials and this is worth the money. My skin feels so smooth and the vitamin C has reduced my dark spots already! Love that it is two steps. Freshly activated product is the best in my opinion. Instant results. I use weekly and love the immediate difference I feel each time I use it. Very simple two step process! Will continue to keep stocked at my house. I try to use this once a month as my 'big' physical exfoliation of the month. The smell is reminiscent of oranges but isn't overpowering. The crystal exfoliator in the jar has a medium-fine grit texture which is nice and uniform throughout. I like using a nice facial oil after I use this exfoliator and I find that it sinks into the skin so nicely. The one aspect I don't really like is the salicylic activating gel. Maybe I'm not using enough of it but I don't find that it foams up on my face. When I first touch it to the crystals there is a little foaming action but as it try to lightly spread it over my skin the foam pretty much dissipates and I'm left with a more opaque crystal mask. I do like the results I achieve after each use so I may rebuy this, not sure yet.\n",
      "…read more This duo will treat your skin just right!! First rub the crystals gently on your face, perhaps a firmer touch on problem areas. My nose is a bit scarred so I use extra time to gently exfoliate. I like to give my hands a quick treatment while I'm doing my face. After rubbing in crystals put on the second lotion. Use about a quarter size. Then the magic begins!! When combined the result will be a warming and soothing lotion. I leave on my skin for about 4 or 5 minutes. Rinse off and your skin will be smooth and glowing!! I have super dry skin but this Philosophy duo do not make my face dry at all !! It is a great way to refresh your skin and let the real you glow. Great product, natural ingredients. Not perfumed. I would reccomend for dry and sensitive skin.\n",
      "…read more Highly recommend. Even first use noticeable difference in smoothness, redness, and pores. Didn’t case irritation or peeling. What can I say about this peel that others haven't already said? Yes, you see instant results in just one try. The first time I used the peel, I asked 2 of my friends to join me. One friend has dark, dark skin, the other is a caramel color, and I have tan skin with yellow undertones. All three of us saw our skin look brighter, fresher, younger, and more dewy just after five minutes. The peel got rid of dryness, smoothed out the skin, and diminished acne scarring. My friends both ended buying the product on their own. The peel is pricey (I got it on sale), but it's lasted me a long time. I will buy again when I run out. I cannot recommend this product enough!\n",
      "…read more I love the scrub and the activator that warms it up and let’s you know it’s working. My skin is baby smooth and exceptionally soft after use, once a week! This is a repeat purchase for me!! It really is a good as they say. My only regret is that I didn’t buy this product sooner! My skin is the softest it’s ever been in recent memory. I’m absolutely floored about how great this product is! Omg I love the way it makes my skin look & feel. Amazing, this product is a hidden gem! I have rough patchy discolored skin. This works wonders and really does Leaves skin feeling smooth. What it does in 3 mins is amazingly fantastic! I absolutely love this peel. I've been using it for the past two years. I love the fresh lemon scent it has to it because it's a light scent. Before using this, I had so much dry skin on my face. After using this, I've noticed immediately that my dry skin was gone. This peel strips out some of the moisture in your skin. So, make sure to use a hydration booster/serum along with a moisturizer right after. My skin glows after I use this. I am actually excited to reach the weekend so I can do this peeling routine. The only down size is its price. Otherwise, i love this!!!! Purchased this amazing product in the month of January, early! I use it every other day. This product truly exceeded my expectations for I am now able to go makeup free with confidence! Before using this product, I would never even consider going anywhere without some type of tinted product on my face for I had major discoloration due to acne scars. And, being that I’m a person who has NEVER written a product review, I just HAD to let others know how super pleased I am with the results I’ve achieved from having used this product!!!! Will be repurchasing!!!!\n",
      "…read more I use this 2x-3x a month. It makes my face soooo glowing and bright instantly. My face is silky soft and pores looks smaller. I really recommend you to try this. I’m lucky I purchased this when it was half price. Definitely going to purchase more when I run out. I’ve been using this product casually for years until recently. My hyperpigmentation has gotten really bad over the past few months and nothing else I’ve tried has made a difference. That is, until I started using this product twice a week. It’s only been 2 wks and I’m seeing a huge improvement in the clearing of my dark marks and the overall texture and complexion of my skin. I honestly can’t believe I’ve been sleeping on such an amazing miracle product! Left alone it would have taken my skin 2 months to clear to this point. It took 2 wks! I’m amazed and elated!\n",
      "…read more I used this product for about 6 months in conjunction with the dr. dennis gross alpha beta peel pads and paula's choice aha/bha toner. I had dramatic results with this combo. I am 45 and have moved on to prescription tretinoin (retin a), but if you are looking for an over the counter solution for your fine lines and wrinkles, I recommend this. I used this in the evenings before bed. My routine after cleansing was: dr dennis gross alpha beta peel on my face, paula's choice aha/bha on my neck and chest, then this serum on both my face and chest.\n",
      "…read more This is my go to overnight serum. I love the creamy texture and my skin loves the way it looks upon wakening. Its light enough to layer and better yet it makes my skin feel moisturized without adding additional product. I have been using this overnight serum for 4 month and I love it . I am on my late 40 and noticed a huge difference on my skin . No dryness and no peeling . I looove this product. It was the first product that I introduced into my skin care routine that showed results with 2 weeks of me using it. I would recommend beginners using it every 2 days for beginning to use it every night. My skin is sensitive but after having my skin get use to this I will not go back. I pair this with PRT un-wrinkle night cream and together work wonders. I can’t live without this! Using only for night time. Helps keep my acne away as it makes my skin softer and smoother. This is magical! Love it so much- my cat scratched my neck, and this healed it quickly, and I didn’t scar. I can only imagine what it’s doing to the rest of my face and neck. I have used this product for about a month and I think it has a good job eliminating my pores! I had lunch with a friend who is a plastic surgeon and he told me the only skin products I really need are a retinol and a good moisturizer. I’m a product junkie and was skeptical at first. Some friends told me a retinol would break out my skin. So I went on to Sephora App and found this Retinol and holy moly, it delivered instant results! It smoothed the bumpy skin on the side of my face within a few days and cleared up old spots! The best part is that my skin never broke out. The product smells like burnt rubber at first but the smell goes away after it’s absorbed. I am VIB Rouge and buy a lot at Sephora but this will go down as the single best purchase!\n",
      "…read more I've been using this for about a week now (with the facial cleanser, daily peel wipes and moisturizer from the Dr. Dennis Gross line), and I love it. I'm already starting to see results. Most noticeably, the size of my pores has been visibly reduced. The beginnings of fine lines on my forehead which prompted the purchase are also starting to fade, but will likely need a few more months before full results show. Also, I haven't experienced any skin sensitivity to the product at all. This is my first time using retinol which I've always heard is drying, but if anything my skin is more moisturized by using the serum. I wake up with a very shiny, moisturized face!\n",
      "…read more I was looking for a overnight serum with retinol, and when I tried the sample, I fell in love with it. I bought and it’s truly lovely. You feel the change in skin immediately, smells great, pumps more than enough for your whole face + neck and it leaves the skin happy and taken care of. I have never experienced such fast results in my life! I used a sample I got and my skin has been so out of wack due to all the rainy weather lately. I put this on before going to bed and my face looked flawless this morning!! Like smooth as a baby’s bottom. No texture reduced pimple size. This is amazing and I am purchasing ASAP Holy grail product for me! Everyone can tell when I’m using it or not!\n"
